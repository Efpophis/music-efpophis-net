  <p>At first I thought I'd continue with my tradition of taking ancient traditional hymns and metal-izing them. But this mellow acoustic version came out so well I had to keep it.</p>

```text
[Verse 1]
O come, O come, Immanuel,
and ransom captive Israel
that mourns in lonely exile here
until the Son of God appear

[Chorus]
Rejoice, Rejoice
Emanuel
shall come to thee, oh Israel

[Verse 2]
O come, thou Dayspring, come and cheer
Our spirits by Thine advent here
Disperse the gloomy clouds of night
and death's dark shadows put to flight

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
O come, O Key of David, come
and open wide our heav'nly home
make safe the way that leads on high
and close the path to misery

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
O come, O King of nations, come 
O Cornerstone that binds in one
refresh the hearts that long for you
restore the broken, make us new

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Rejoice, Rejoice
Emanuel
shall come to thee, oh Israel
