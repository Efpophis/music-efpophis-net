notes: 'This is inspired heavily by a popular Maranatha "praise and worship" song from the early 1990s that I always enjoyed. The other guilty pleasure I enjoyed from the 1990s was alternative and grunge rock, especially the heavier stuff. As such, I really like the vocals in this one.'

[Verse 1]
You shall go out with joy
And be led forth with peace
The mountains and the hills shall cry out
The rocks and stones shall sing His praise

And all the trees of the fields shall clap their hands
The LORD Yahweh Shall be praised!
And all the trees of the fields shall clap their hands
The LORD our God shall forever be exalted!

The word of the LORD endures forever
The word of Yahweh is eternal
The word of the LORD endures forever
The word of Yahweh is eternal
