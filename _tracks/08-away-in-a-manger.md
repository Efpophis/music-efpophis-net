[Verse]
Away in a manger, no crib for a bed,
The little LORD Jesus laid down His sweet head;
The stars in the heavens looked down where He lay,
The little LORD Jesus, asleep on the hay.

[Interlude]
[Instrumental: guitar]

[Verse]
The cattle are lowing, the Baby awakes,
But little LORD Jesus, no crying He makes.
I love you, LORD Jesus, look down from the sky
And stay by my side until morning is nigh.

[Interlude]
[Instrumental: guitar]

[Verse]
Be near me, Lord Jesus; I ask you to stay
Close by me forever, and love me, I pray.
Bless all the dear children in Your tender care,
And fit us for Heaven, to live with You there.
(repeat once)
