  <p>This song dates back to 1709, written by Thomas Ken. At my old church, I remember singing Verse 2 as a way to wrap up the service, so I've put it here to wrap up the main section of the album. I also remember singing Verse 1 in my high-school choir, and thinking they were separate songs that happened to sound very similar. In fact, there is apparently a pile of old hymns and songs that use the same tune, the "Tallis' Canon," dating back to around 1561!</p>

  <p>I'd always wanted to put a modern spin on it, and I think this "symphonic power metal" version really hits the spot.</p>

```text
[Verse 1]
All praise to Thee, my God, this night
For all the blessings of the light
Keep me, oh keep me, King of Kings
Within the shelter of Thy wings

[Verse 2]
Praise God, from whom all blessings flow!
Praise Him, all creatures here below!
Praise Him above, ye heavenly host!
Praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost!
