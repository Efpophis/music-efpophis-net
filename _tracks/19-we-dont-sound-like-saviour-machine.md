notes: "Saviour Machine is my favorite band, and I'd give my left vocal cord to sound like that band's founder and lead singer, Eric Clayton. This is a tongue-in-cheek parody featuring several of Saviour Machine's song titles. Fans will understand."

[Verse 1]
We gaze into The Wicked Window's eyes
Behold, The Ludicrous Smiles
The Force of the Entity reigns on me
As Legion moves over the land

[Verse 2]
The Widow and the Bride say, "Come!"
And the Son of the Rain takes control
The Mask is removed, the Killer exposed
As Christians and Lunatics search for the light ...

[Bridge]
I've heard this message before
I never thought that we could sound like them

[Chorus]
We don't sound like Saviour Machine
We only follow Jesus Christ in A World Alone
We wish we sounded like Saviour Machine
'Cause Saviour Machine is our favorite band.

[Interlude]
[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
The power of Paradox compels the Ceremony.
In American Babylon, True Love Never Dies.
As a Child in Silence, we must take The Stand!
As the Carnival of Souls marches on!

[Verse 4]
The Idol Enters past the Gates!
The Eyes of the Storm bleed before the Lamb
As the Woman flees the Beast into the night
And the Bride of Christ comes alive!

[Bridge]
I've heard this message before
I never thought we could sound like them

[Chorus]
We don't sound like Saviour Machine
We only follow Jesus Christ in A World Alone
We wish we sounded like Saviour Machine
'Cause Saviour Machine is our favorite band.

[Interlude]
[Instrumental]

[Ending]
