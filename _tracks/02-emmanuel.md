notes: |
  <p>This is the title track, since "Emmanuel" means 'God is with us' in Hebrew.</p>

  <p>I created this by recording myself singing along with the first verse of Emmanuel from "Yahweh Our Light," and then feeding my vocals into the AI. I convinced it to metal it up a bit, and this is the result.</p>

```text
[Verse 1]
O come, O come, Emmanuel,
And ransom captive Israel
That mourns in lonely exile here
Until the Son of God appear

[Chorus]
Rejoice, Rejoice
Emmanuel
Shall come to thee, oh Israel

[Verse 2]
O come, thou Dayspring, come and cheer
Our Spirits by Thine Advent here
Disperse the gloomy clouds of night
And death's dark shadows put to flight

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
O come, O Key of David, come
And open wide our heav'nly home
Make safe the way that leads on high
And close the path to misery

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
O come, O King of nations, come 
O Cornerstone that binds in one
Refresh the hearts that long for You
Restore the broken, make us new

[Chorus]
