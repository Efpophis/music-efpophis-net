notes: |
  <p>This was a very early Redeemer tune composed by our drummer, Scott Mattson. It was originally an acoustic ballad and one of our only songs where I sang backing vocals since there was no keyboard part for me to worry about. It was a real pain to recover the lyrics as none of us could remember them. Finally, Mark Fisher managed to find an old demo cassette tape and an even older cassette player and was able to recover the lyrics.</p>
  
  <p>This version is re-imagined as a 1980s hair-metal ballad. The female vocals are an interesting take, but overall, I like it. This is one of the few times Mr. Microchips managed to create a decent ending, so the song is 100% as-generated with no editing on my part.</p>

[Verse 1]
I know you feel alone
I know you feel as if no one understands
I wanted to let you know
There's a true love out there
Just believe me and take Jesus hand

[Chorus] 
And I know all the tears you cried
And I know all the fears you hide
It hurts I know, I've been there before
I've been there before
I've been there before

[Verse 2]
I want you to know the one 
Who came and died to set you free
Who loves you, can't you see?

[Chorus] 
And I know all the tears you cried
And I know all the fears you hide
It hurts I know, I've been there before
I've been there before
I've been there before

[Bridge]
(Instrumental)

[Verse 3]
No more pain and no more fear
Everlasting peace year after year
Open up and let Jesus in
You'll be free forever from the burden of sin

[Chorus] 
And I know all the tears you cried
And I know all the fears you hide
It hurts I know, I've been there before
I've been there before
I've been there before

[Chorus]
He knows all the tears you cried
He knows all the fears you hide
It hurts, Jesus Knows, He's been there before
He's been there before
He's been there before
He's been there before
```
