notes: |
  <p>This track is special. It's an outlier in that it's not full-on extreme black metal, for one thing.</p>

  <p>Mainly, tho, it's special because it actually features my own vocals. That's right - the first "pie Jesu Domine, dona eis requiem" that you hear is 100% me. I was able to feed that sound into the AI and have it pick up the characteristics of my voice and generate the rest of the song from it. And it all still sounds like my voice - pretty cool, huh?</p>

  <p>Thanks to Monty Python and the Holy Grail (if you know, you know), and apologies to everyone else who has done a proper Pie Jesu to music.</p>
  <p>Watch it on YouTube <a href="https://youtu.be/QAg-0A3QfeI?si=cuayNbU4XwUMcaVk" target=_blank>here</a>.</p>
