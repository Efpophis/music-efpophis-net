slug: 14-exsequiae
album: seven
album_title: "Seven"
artist: "The Redeemer Project"
track_number: 14
notes: "This was originally part of Requiem Ex Mortis, but I cut it from that album since I was running out of room and it was kinda repetitive with respect to the rest of the album. I think it stands up just fine on its own and makes a good addition to this album, though."
