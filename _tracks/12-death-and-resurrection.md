notes: |
  <p>The background music was generated by Mr. Microchips. My voice provides the English words. The other languages are samples I found on the internet and mixed in.</p>

  <p>I've called this track "Death and Resurrection" because, in praying the sinner's prayer, acknowledging our sin, repenting, and accepting Jesus, we symbolically die with Him. If we pray this, or something like it, in faith, believing the words with all our heart, then our old life is over. We die to ourselves, and are born again to Christ - hence the resurrection part.</p>

  <p>This is the death that frees us from death and leads us to resurrection and eternal life. While definitely the simplest track on the album, it's also the title track for this reason. Its message is the most important, and the most powerful. If I had known, 33 years ago, how much saying these words for the first time would alter the course of my life, I never would have believed it.</p>

  <p>If you never have before, and even if you think you have, but it's been a while since you've thought about any of this, then I encourage you to listen closely and pray these words with me. Take them to heart. Let them change your life. Let them change your eternity.</p>

[Spoken]

Lord Jesus Christ, Son of Yahweh the one true God, the Almighty ... 

I know I am a sinner. I know my sins have kept me from knowing You. Today, I want that to change.

I know I need You to be my savior. I need Your mercy and grace, Lord Jesus.

I turn away from my sins and ask You to forgive them all. 

I believe that You died for me, in my place, and that You rose again, just as the scripture says. 

Have mercy on me, Lord Jesus!

In faith, I accept You into my heart and into my life as my lord and savior forever. 

I pray this all in Jesus' mighty name. Amen.
