  <p>Everone knows the best news headlines always start with the words "Florida Man ... "</p>

  <p>I envisioned a [not so] superhero show with a theme song, and this is what came out.</p>

  <p>I have experimented with several non-metal genres and fusions for this album. This one is pure bluegrass, nothing else. There's no Christian message here - just good old-fashioned Florida Man hijinks. If it makes you laugh or giggle, then mission accomplished.</p>

[Verse]
Livin' in the Sunshine State
Where the wild things grow
Causin' chaos everywhere he goes
From Jacksonville to Miami Beach
He might be crazy, but he's got a plan
They call him Florida Man

[Bridge]
Who's that weirdo? He's no hero
He's Florida Man! Florida Man!

[Chorus]
Florida man, Florida man 
gettin' himself in trouble like no one else can
Who's that weirdo? He's no hero
He's Florida Man

[Verse 2]
He's got a giant pet gator livin' in his backyard,
He's sippin' vodka and orange juice, smokin' weed cigars,
He's Ridin' to the Publix on his new lawnmower, drivin' drunk with no pants on
Wearin' flip flops in a hurricane, dancin' naked in the rain
Florida Man's his name!
He's drivin' folks insane

[Bridge]
Who's that weirdo? He's our hero
He's Florida man! 

[Chorus]
Florida man, Florida man 
makin' the headlines like no one else can
Who's that weirdo? He's our hero
He's Florida Man
They call him Florida Man


[Bridge]
Who's that weirdo, he's our hero
He's Florida man, they call him Florida Man!

Look out, world, here comes Florida Man!
