```text
[Verse 1]
Famine devastates the land
That has forgotten Yahweh.
"No rain shall come, unless I decree,"
God's prophet has proclaimed.

[Verse 2]
Hiding in the desert
With a widow and her son,
God provides in mercy
The prophet's faith confirmed.

[Chorus]
"As I live," says Yahweh
"Your grain shall not run out,
Nor shall your well run dry. 
In desolation, your faithful God provides."

[Verse 3: female vocals]
"But what is this? My son is sick!
Behold, he breathes no more!
Has Yahweh come to kill my son?
And end my house forevermore?"

[Verse 4: male vocals]
"Bring him to me," the prophet spoke
And prayed for mercy for the boy.
God heard his prayer, his soul returned
"Behold, your son shall live once more!"

[Chorus]
"As I live," says Yahweh
"I am the resurrection;
The keys of life and death are Mine.
By My hand, the widow's son shall rise"

[Verse 5]
The widow wept with tears of joy
And received her son, back from the grave
"Now I know Yahweh is with you,
And in time, I'll rejoice to see His day."

[Chorus]
"As I live," says Yahweh
"Life is faith and faith is life. 
Believe in Me, and you shall never die.
In resurrection, the faithful dead shall rise"

RISE!
