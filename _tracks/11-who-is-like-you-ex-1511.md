Who is like you, oh LORD? 
Among all that is called 'God' ...
Who is like Yahweh?
In splendor and holiness
Oh LORD, there is no other

Who is like you, oh LORD?
Awesome in worship and power
Who is like Yahweh? 
Doing wonders before our eyes? 
Oh LORD, there is no other

מי כמכה באלים אדני
מי כמכה נאדר בקדש
נורא תהלות עשה פלא
עשה פלא
