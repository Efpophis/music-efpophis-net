  <p>It's ok to ask questions. Everyone has them. God would rather you ask questions, complain, even get angry and yell at him - all are much more preferable to him than for you to stop talking to him at all.</p>
  <p>These are a few of mine.</p>

[Intro]
[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Where did we come from?
Where are we going?
What is your name?
What do you want?
Why are we here?
How did we get here?

[Interlude]

[Verse 2]
Are we still alive?
Can you see the signs?
What is truth? What is a lie?
What happens to us when we die?
Will you save us all?
Are you the one who lives again?

[Bridge]
Where are you taking us?
Why is this happening?
What are you doing?
How can this be?

[Chorus]
What must I do?
What should I believe?
Will you forgive me?
Will you heal my disease?
Can you save my soul from hell?
Can you save me from myself?
Do you like my songs?
Do you listen to me at all?

[Interlude]
[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
Why does this hurt so bad?
What is your master plan?
What am I supposed to do now?
When will I understand?
When will you reveal yourself to me?
When will I finally see?

[Interlude]

[Verse 4]
Can you show me the light?
Can we escape the night?
Is this the end of all things?
What will our legacy be?
When will all of this be over?
What will happen next?

[Bridge]
Are you there watching?
Do you even exist at all?
Does anything matter?
Is anything real?
How can you sleep at night?
How does it feel?

[Chorus]
What must I do?
What should I believe?
Will you forgive me?
Will you heal my disease?
Can you save my soul from hell?
Can you save me from myself?
Do you like my songs?
Do you listen to me at all?

[Interlude]

[Ending]
