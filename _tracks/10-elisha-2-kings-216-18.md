notes: |
  <p>For this track, I imagined Elisha contemplating his master and friend's departure and taking up his responsibilities. He looks to God for help in the present, while envisioning the time of Christ in the far future.</p>

  <p>Thus ends the concept part of the album.</p>

[Verse 1]
A cycle completes
A cycle begins
The time of Elijah has ended
The day of Elisha has dawned

[Verse 2]
I saw the storm, felt the heat of the fire
The horsemen of Yahweh carried my master away
Now I bear his mantle, and double his power
לעלות רוח הקודש (Arise, Holy Spirit)
בָּרוּך השם אדונאי (Blessed be the name of the LORD)

[Bridge]
בָּרוּךְ אַתָּה יְהוָה אֱלֹהֵינוּ (Blessed are you, Yahweh our God)
אלוהים ישועתי (God our Salvation)

[Chorus]
Blessed be the name of the LORD our God
Yahweh my salvation
Who calls me in my master's stead
To go into the world ...

[Verse 3]
A cycle completes
A cycle begins
The time of Elijah has ended
The day of Elisha has dawned

[Bridge]
בָּרוּךְ אַתָּה יְהוָה אֱלֹהֵינוּ (Blessed are you, Yahweh our God)
אלוהים ישועתי (God our Salvation)

[Chorus]
Blessed be the name of the LORD our God
Yahweh my salvation
Who calls me in my master's stead
To go into the world ...

[Verse 4]
A cycle completes
A cycle begins
The time of Elijah has ended
The day of Yeshua has dawned

[Bridge]
בָּרוּךְ אַתָּה יְהוָה אֱלֹהֵינוּ (Blessed are you, Yahweh our God)
אלוהים ישועתי (God our Salvation)

[Chorus]
Blessed be the name of the LORD our God
Yahweh my salvation
Who calls me in my master's name
To go into the world ...
To go into the world ...
To go into all the world.

[Ending]
