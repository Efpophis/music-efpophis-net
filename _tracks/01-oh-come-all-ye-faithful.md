  <p>What better way to start off a Christmas metal album than with a techno track, right? I know, it's not metal, but it works, and I like it.</p>

  <p>Traditionally, we sang this song with the first and last verses in Latin. But, the AI apparently hates Latin and just can't do it right, so I had to cut it out.</p>

[Verse 1]
Oh come all ye faithful
Joyful and triumphant
Oh come ye, oh come ye
To Bethlehem

Come and behold Him,
Born the king of angels

[Chorus]
Oh come let us adore Him
Oh come let us adore Him
Oh come let us adore Him
Christ, the Lord

[Verse 2]
Sing, choirs of angels
Sing in exultation
Sing, all ye citizens
Of Heaven above

Glory to God
All Glory in the highest

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Yea, Lord, we greet Thee
Born this holy morning
Jesus to Thee be all glory giv'n

Word of the Father
Now, in flesh, appearing

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Oh come, let us adore Him
Oh come, let us adore Him
Oh come, let us adore Him
Christ, the LORD!
