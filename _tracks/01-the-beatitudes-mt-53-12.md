[Verse 1]
Blessed are the poor in spirit,
For theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
Blessed are those who mourn,
for they shall be comforted.
Blessed are the meek,
For they shall inherit the earth

[Bridge]
Blessed are those who
hunger and thirst for righteousness
For they shall all be filled!

[Chorus]
[Instrumental]


[Verse 2]
Blessed are the merciful
For they shall be shown mercy
Blessed are the pure in heart
For they shall see God!
Blessed are the peacemakers,
For they shall be called the children of God!

[Bridge]
Blessed are those who are persecuted
For the sake of righteousness
For theirs is the kingdom of heaven!

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Blessed are you, when people revile you
When they persecute you
When they speak evil of you falsely
For my name's sake

[Outro]
Rejoice and be exceedingly glad,
For great is your reward in heaven
For so they persecuted the prophets
Who came before

[Chorus]

[Ending]
