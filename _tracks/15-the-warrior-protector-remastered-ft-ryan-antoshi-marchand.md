notes: |
  <p>The first lines of this song are taken from two separate proverbs: "If you want peace, prepare for war" [si vis pacem, para bellum], and "It's better to be a warrior in a garden than a gardener in a war." I've come to believe that a lot of Christians have gotten pacifism wrong. They think that being peaceful means lacking even the capability of violence. I contend that such a state does not make one peaceful - it only makes one helpless. To be peaceful, I believe one must be capable of violence - great violence if necessary - and choose, of their own free will, not to exercise it. The greatest example of this from scripture that I can think of is Jesus in the garden, when the Romans came to arrest him. He, of all people, being also God, was certainly capable of defending himself, and he even said so. He told Peter, "put your sword back in its place, for these things must happen." He did not tell Peter, "get rid of your sword, you shouldn't even have it." This implies that there is a time and place for violence, but only as a last resort and for a righteous cause. This is the philosophy I've adopted and am learning how to emulate.</p>

[Verse]
If you seek to live in peace
You must prepare to fight
better a warrior in a garden
than a gardener in a war

[Verse 2]
In the quiet of the night
He moves without a sound
Guarding all that he loves
He stands on solid ground

[Chorus]
Warrior in the shadows
Protector of his own
The power of the ninja
Comes from deep within the soul

[Break]
[Interlude]
[Instrumental: guitar]

[Verse 3]
With every step he takes
The winds begin to change
Whispers in the void
awaken the inner flame

[Bridge]
Hands move like the wind
Immovable as the mountain
He flows like a river
and strikes with the power of the storm

[Chorus]
Warrior in the shadows
Protector of his own
The power of the ninja
Comes from deep within the soul

[Verse 3]
With every step he takes
The winds begin to change
Whispers in the void
awaken the inner flame

[Bridge]
Hands move like the wind
Immovable as the mountain
He flows like a river
and strikes with the power of the storm

[Chorus]
Warrior in the shadows
Protector of his own
The power of the ninja
Comes from deep within the soul

[Ending]
