  <p>At last, Elijah's struggles are over, and God grants him an extraordinary favor: he is taken into heaven without having to face death. The scripture says he was taken by a whirlwind of fire, with flaming chariots and horses.</p>

  <p>His disciple, Elisha, witnessed these events and, with a double portion of God's spirit, he picked up where Elijah left off.</p>
