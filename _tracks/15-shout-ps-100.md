  <p>Honestly, I was never much of a fan of Ozzy Osbourne or Black Sabbath. I didn't get into heavy metal until after my conversion to Christianity, and my first exposure to the genre consisted entirely of Christian bands like Deliverance, Stryper, Believer, Mortification, Saviour Machine, etc. I still don't listen to secular metal - at least not on purpose, and definitely not on a regular basis. There's plenty of really good Christian stuff out there, so I don't really feel the need to entertain the secular stuff.</p>

  <p>With all that said, tho, most of those Christian artists I mentioned were influenced by their secular counterparts. And no one can deny that Ozzy and Black Sabbath were pioneers in the genre. Many of those bands I enjoy wouldn't exist or wouldn't be what they are if Ozzy and Sabbath had never been more than an inconsequential garage band. Ozzy's passing does mark the end of an era in music, and, regardless of everything else you can say about him, good or bad, he undeniably changed the world for the better.</p>

  <p>So, with that in mind, I felt it appropriate to give my own little tribute in the form of a psalm in (more or less) their style. It is my sincere hope that this is what Heaven has been sounding like since Ozzy's passing.</p>

[Chorus]
Shout to Yahweh, All the Earth!
Serve Him with Joy, with all your might
Come before Him with songs of praise
Come before Him with shouts of joy

[Verse 1]
Know that Yahweh is God, there is no other
He created us all. He created all things
And we are His people
We are the sheep of His pasture
Yes Lord!

[Instrumental]

[Verse 2]
Come into His gates with thanksgiving in your heart
Come into His courts with praise on your lips
Give thanks to Yahweh and bless His mighty Name
Give thanks to Yahweh and bless His holy Name
Oh yes, Lord!

[Chorus]
Shout to Yahweh, All the Earth!
Serve Him with Joy, with all your might
Come before Him with songs of praise
Come before Him with shouts of joy

[Verse 3]
For Yahweh is good, there is no other
His kindness is eternal, His mercy is forever
His faithfulness endures from age to age
His love endures from generation to generation
Have mercy, Lord!

[Chorus]
Shout to Yahweh, All the Earth!
Serve Him with Joy, with all your might
Come before Him with songs of praise
Come before Him with shouts of joy

[Instrumental]

Shout to Yahweh, All the Earth!
Serve Him with Joy, with all your might
Come before Him with songs of praise
Come before Him with shouts of joy

[Ending]
