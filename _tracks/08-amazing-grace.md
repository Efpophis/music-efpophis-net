notes: |
  <p>Well .. it's amazing grace in old-school thrash metal. OG Redeemer attempted to do a cover of it once, so I thought, why not?</p>
  <p>The chorus is taken from the Greek orthodox "Jesus prayer," and translates to:</p>
  <p>"Lord Jesus Christ, son of God, have mercy on me, a sinner"</p>

[Verse 1]
Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost, but now am found
Was blind, but now I see

[Verse 2]
'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear
And grace my fears relieved
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed

[Chorus]
Kyrie Iesou Christe, Yie tou Theou, Eleison me ton amartalon.
Kyrie Iesou Christe, Yie tou Theou, Eleison me ton amartalon.

[Verse 3]
The Lord has promised good to me
His word my hope secures
He will my shield and portion be
As long as life endures

[Bridge]
Through many dangers, toils, and snares
I have already come
'Tis grace that's brought me safe thus far
And grace will lead me home

[Chorus]
Kyrie Iesou Christe, Yie tou Theou, Eleison me ton amartalon.
Kyrie Iesou Christe, Yie tou Theou, Eleison me ton amartalon.
