  <p>I was reading Isaiah one morning and happened upon this chapter. It's copied word-for-word from the Jerusalem Bible translation of Isaiah 34. After reading it, I thought "Wow, Isaiah is kinda metal!" So I threw in verse 7 from Revelation and there you have it - instant biblical death metal.</p>

[Intro]
[Interlude]
[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Come here and listen, all you races.
Pay attention, all you nations.
Listen, Earth, and all you hold,
World, and all that comes from you!

[Verse 2]
Yahweh is angry with all the nations,
Enraged with all their hordes.
He has vowed them to destruction,
And marked them down for slaughter!
(repeat verse 2)

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
Their dead are thrown into the streets,
A stench rises from their corpses,
The mountains run with their blood,
The armies of heaven .. ROT!

[Interlude]
[Instrumental]

[Verse 4]
The heavens are rolled up like a scroll
And their armies all drop like leaves,
Like falling leaves from a vine
Like fig leaves falling from their tree

[Interlude]
[Instrumental]

[Verse 5]
"For my sword has drunk deep in the heavens..
Behold, it slashes through them all,
Through the people I condemn to perdition."

[Interlude]
[Instrumental]

[Verse 6]
And the kings of the Earth, 
The rich and the poor,
The free and the slave,
Flee to the mountains for asylum in caves

[Verse 7]
And they cry, "Fall on us, hide us away
From He who is seated on the throne, and His Son!
The great day of their wrath is upon us,
And who can stand against them?"

[Interlude]
[Instrumental]

[Ending]
