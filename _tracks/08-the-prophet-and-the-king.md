  <p>I skipped over a lot to get to this one. There were some wars, with both victory and defeat predicted by the prophet and fulfilled in kind. Finish up 1 Kings for that information. Now, Elijah is nearing the end of his ministry, and will soon be taken into heaven alive. He's done all he can to warn Israel and the king about the dangers of serving other gods and abandoning Yahweh. Judgment is coming.</p>

  <p>But it's not all gloom and doom. Nowhere in the bible does it say "God's wrath endures forever." Rather, it says just about everywhere that his love and mercy endure forever. In the end, God will save not only his people Israel, but the whole world, too.</p>

[Verse 1]
I tried to warn you. I tried to tell you
God will not be mocked. Yahweh is no fool
But you wouldn't listen, you refuse to hear his voice
Soon I'll be gone, and you'll be left alone
Like bones in the dirt, to reap all you have sown

[Verse 2]
Dark times are coming, like none have ever seen
You worship idols made by hands, that neither walk nor speak
So God will make you like them, the king of dust, you'll be
Soon the prophet will be gone, and you'll be all alone
Like bones in the dirt, to reap all you have sown

[Bridge]
How many times did I warn you?
Follow Yahweh, and serve him alone!
Oh, king, you should have heeded
For now, you must atone...

[Chorus]
Behold, the desolation
The opening of the tomb
The prophet and the king have gone
And we must face our doom

[Verse 3]
In time, I pray you learn That Yahweh is our hope
The only God who lives and breathes, and calls us as His own
He won't forget His promise, He will save us in the end
His wrath is not forever, His mercy will endure
Messiah will restore our souls, and raise us from the ground!

[Bridge]
The time is short, the day is near
Follow Yahweh and serve him alone!
The king, the holy lamb of God
Will all our sins atone!

[Chorus]
Behold, the restoration!
Life springs from the tomb!
The prophet and the king shall come
And save us from our doom

[Bridge]
The time is short, the day is near
Follow Yahweh and serve him alone!
The king, the holy lamb of God
Will all our sins atone!

[Outro]
Behold, the restoration!
Life springs from the tomb!
The prophet and the king shall come
And save us from our doom

[Ending]
