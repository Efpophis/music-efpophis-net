notes: |
  <p>This is another Wonderboy PhD cover, also used with the full permission and blessing of the original band and owners of the song. Mark Rounds, our guitarist, composed this and originally played it solo on an acoustic guitar. This was also the very last song played at the very last Wonderboy PhD performance, for which I had the honor of being present in the audience. </p>

  <p>Well done, guys.</p>

```text
[Verse 1]
Here I am down on my knees
I'm praying to You cuz I don't know anymore
Who I am or who I could be
Please hear me cuz I don't know anymore

[Chorus]
And Jesus, come here and be with me
And help me to do what is right
And cleanse me, remove this guilt from me
Forgive me, and give me the peace of Your love

[Verse 2]
I live my life by day, and a different one by night
I'm two separate people, and I don't know anymore
If I could live all my life for You
And everything that I have, I'm giving everything to You

[Chorus]
And Jesus, come here and be with me
And help me to do what is right
And cleanse me, remove this guilt from me
Forgive me, and give me the peace of Your love

[Chorus]
And Jesus, come here and be with me
And help me to do what is right
And cleanse me, remove this guilt from me
Forgive me, and give me the peace of Your love
```
