notes: |
  <p>I took this directly from John Chapter 1, which scholars believe was taken from an ancient hymn or chant. The idea is to focus on the Deity of Jesus Christ, how He existed long before being born as a man for our salvation, and what He accomplished by doing so.</p>

  <p>The Greek word used here for "the word" is "Logos." The author used this word deliberately and borrowed a concept from Greek philosophy and religion. Of course, the ancient Greeks believed in Zeus and Hermes and a whole pantheon of gods, as well as in the Titans who ruled before and were overthrown by them. But, all of those gods had beginnings. When they wanted to express the eternal, uncreated origin and creator of all things, even their own gods, they used the word "logos" - the word. It is this Word who would eventually reveal Himself in the burning bush to Moses and name Himself Yahweh, and who, as John testifies, became flesh as a man named Yeshua or Jesus.</p>

[Intro]
[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
In the beginning was the Word
And the Word was with God
And the Word was God
And the Word was God
And the Word was God

[Verse 2]
And all that came to be had life in Him
That life was the light of men,
The light that shines in the darkness
And the darkness will never prevail
YEAH!!

[Bridge]
The only Son of the Father Almighty
The Son of Yahweh has come

[Chorus]
And the Word became flesh
And dwelt among us
The Word became flesh
And we saw His glory
Full of Grace and Truth

[Interlude]
[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
He is the true light
Who enlightens us all
He came into the world
But the world could not believe

[Verse 4]
But to those who believed Him
To those who received Him
He gave the power to become
The children of God
The children of God
The children of God

[Bridge]
Behold, the lamb of God
Who takes away the sins of the world

[Chorus]
And the Word became flesh
And dwelt among us
The Word became flesh
And we saw His glory
Full of Grace and Truth

[Interlude]
[Instrumental]

[Outro]
And the Word became flesh
And dwelt among us
The Word became flesh
And we saw His glory
Full of Grace and Truth

[Ending]
