notes: "This has always been one of my favorites, so I had to do something special for it. First, I re-wrote the lyrics to the second verse. Second, I based this version on a recording of myself singing the first verse acapella. From there, the AI was able to synthesize an approximation of my own voice for the rest of the song. I ended up cutting out the acapella part, tho, because it didn't really fit with the style of what was generated."

[Verse 1]
What Child is this, who laid to rest,
On Mary's lap is sleeping?
Whom angels greet with anthems sweet,
While shepherds watch are keeping?

[Chorus]
This, this is Christ, the King,
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing:
Haste! Haste to bring Him laud,
The Babe, the Son of Mary!

[Verse 2]
What child is this, who is so blessed
That sage and prophet seek Him?
Who's mercy, sweet, and love complete
Shall save those who receive Him?

[Chorus]
This, this is Christ, the King,
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing:
Haste, haste to bring Him laud,
The Babe, the Son of Mary!

[Verse 3]
So bring Him incense, gold, and myrrh,
Come, peasant, king to own Him.
The King of Kings, salvation brings;
Let loving hearts enthrone Him.

[Chorus]
This, this is Christ, the King,
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing:
Haste, haste to bring Him laud,
The Babe, the Son of Mary!

(Repeat Chorus)
