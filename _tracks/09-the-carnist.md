[Intro]
[Instrumental] 

[Verse 1]
They roam the farm yard
Eating their bugs
They've no idea 
What is to come

[Verse 2]
Mechanically separated
Batter fried
Entombed in cardboard
For five ninety-nine 

[Bridge] 
They'll be my lunch
My sustenance

[Chorus]
My stomach is a grave (I am the carnist)
No plant can satisfy me (I am the carnist) 
Make it sweet and savory (I am the carnist) 
And I devour them all!

[Breakdown] 
KENTUCKY!!
FRIED!!
DEATH!

[Instrumental: guitar solo] 

[Bridge] 
They'll be my lunch
My sustenance

[Chorus]
My stomach is a grave (I am the carnist)
No plant can satisfy me (I am the carnist) 
Make it sweet and savory (I am the carnist) 
And I devour them all!

[Breakdown] 
KENTUCKY!!
FRIED!!
DEATH!!

[Interlude]
[Instrumental]

[Bridge] 
They'll be my lunch
My sustenance

[Chorus]
My stomach is a grave (I am the carnist)
No plant can satisfy me (I am the carnist) 
Make it sweet and savory (I am the carnist) 
And I devour them all!

[Ending] 
KENTUCKY!!
FRIED!!
DEATH!!
