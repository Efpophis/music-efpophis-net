  I recovered this track from an ancient cassette tape I found in my basement that had a few old Redeemer recordings on it. It's loosely based on a couple of psalms. I had completely forgotten we had even done it until I heard it on the tape. I figured it would make a good "majestic doom metal" piece, and apparently I was not wrong.

```text
[Verse 1]
I will cry out to you, Jesus
Who performs all things for me
And You will send from Heaven
And save me from my enemies

[Verse 2]
My soul is among the lions
My heart is torn by words
Teeth of arrow, tongue of fire
I know I am safe

[Chorus]
Be exalted oh LORD
Be exalted oh LORD
Be exalted oh LORD

[Verse 3]
They think to capture me
To make me bow, to toss me in
But it's You, oh God who casts them in
And delivers me

[Verse 4]
My heart is set on Jesus
I sing and give Him praise
Awake, our instruments, for early we rise
To sing our praise, sing our praise

[Bridge]
I will sing your praise to those who hear
To the nations, I will cry
Of Your great and never-ending love

[Chorus]
Be exalted oh LORD
Be exalted oh LORD
Be exalted oh LORD

[Verse 5]
Have mercy oh God, have mercy on me
You know my soul relies on you
I hide in your hand of love
Until you have made it safe once more

[Chorus]
Be exalted oh LORD
Be exalted oh LORD

[Verse 6]
Have mercy oh God, have mercy on me
You know my soul relies on You
I hide in Your hand of love
Until You have made it safe once more

[Chorus]
Be exalted oh LORD
Be exalted oh LORD
We sing our praise to You, and only to You
Be exalted oh LORD
Be exalted oh LORD
