[Intro]

[Verse 1]
You're the chosen one, and you bear my mark
You've been having some fun (like a walk in the park)
Learning magic at Hogwarts this year.
But I've got a spell that'll send you to hell,
And wipe that smug grin right off your face.

[Verse 2]
Oh, it worked on your mom, and it worked on your dad
And it worked on that Digory kid, too (oh yeah)
And now that I have Dumbledore's wand,
I'm sure it's gonna work on you (it'll work on you, too)

[Bridge]
You're the boy who lived (much to my surprise)
Now it's time to die (so I can survive)
So meet me in the forest tonight (in the forest tonight)

[Chorus]
I'll say "Avada Kedavra," and a flash of green light
Will be the last thing that you'll ever see! (you ever see)
Unless you're my horcrux, then you'll be all right,
And the joke's gonna be on me!
I'll say "Avada Kedavra," and a flash of green light
Will be the last thing that you'll ever see! (you ever see)
Unless you're my horcrux, then you'll be all right,
And the joke's gonna be on me! (Let's see!)

[Interlude]

[Verse 3]
Well, you stopped that professor
With your mother's true love,  
And I was under his hat all along! (how weird was that)
And you killed that basilisk and somehow survived, 
'Cause that phoenix showed up just in time! (just in time)
And you found out the truth about Sirius Black,
And it was Weasley's rat the whole time!

[Verse 4]
But now I've returned, (he's really back!)
And the world's gonna burn (he's on the attack)
As soon as I take over this school (any time now)
But don't speak my name, since You Know Who I am!
'Cause I've got a spell that'll send you to hell!
Oh, it's as plain as the nose on my face!

[Bridge]
You're the boy who lived (much to my surprise)
Now it's time to die (so I can survive)
So meet me in the forest tonight (in the forest tonight)

[Chorus]
I'll say "Avada Kedavra," and a flash of green light
Will be the last thing that you'll ever see! (you ever see)
Unless you're my horcrux, then you'll be all right,
And the joke's gonna be on me!
I'll say "Avada Kedavra," and a flash of green light
Will be the last thing that you'll ever see! (you ever see)
Unless you're my horcrux, then you'll be all right,
And the joke's gonna be on me! (Let's see!)

[Interlude]

[Bridge]
You're the boy who lived (much to my surprise)
Now it's time to die (so I can survive)
So meet me in the forest tonight (in the forest tonight)

[Chorus]
I'll say "Avada Kedavra," and a flash of green light
Will be the last thing that you'll ever see! (you ever see)
Unless you're my horcrux, then you'll be all right,
And the joke's gonna be on me!
I'll say "Avada Kedavra," and a flash of green light
Will be the last thing that you'll ever see! (you ever see)
Unless you're my horcrux, then you'll be all right,
And the joke's gonna be on me! (Let's see!)

[Interlude]
[Instrumental]

[Outro]
I'll say "Avada Kedavra," and a flash of green light
Will be the last thing that you'll ever see! (you ever see)
Unless you're my horcrux, then you'll be all right,
And the joke's gonna be on me! (Let's see!)

[Ending]
