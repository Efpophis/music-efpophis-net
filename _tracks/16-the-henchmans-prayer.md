This is what [Centurion](/tracks/11-centurion-matt-2754) originally sounded like.

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
You came to me
Like so many had before
Doomed to die
I heard their shouts "Let him be crucified"

[Verse 2]
Bound by hand and foot,
I beat you with my scourge of rock and bone
I spilled your blood not knowing
It would one day save my soul
It would one day save my soul

[Chorus]
And now I come to you
I plead the blood
I shed by my own hand
Father God forgive me
For I knew not what I did

[Verse 3]
You left my whip
Beaten one lash short of death
You looked at me through hurt and bleeding eyes
And looking past the blood I saw the love
The love that crowns and crucifies
Crowns and crucifies

[Chorus]
And now I come to you
I plead the blood
I shed by my own hand
Father God forgive me
For I knew now what I did
I knew not what I did

[Verse 4]
You rose again
Like no one had before
Victorious over satan's darkest grave
And looking in your face I saw the light
And on my knees, I pray
And on my knees, I pray

[Chorus]
And now I come to you
I plead the blood
I shed by my own hand
Father God forgive me
For I knew now what I did
I knew not what I did

[Outro]
[Instrumental]
