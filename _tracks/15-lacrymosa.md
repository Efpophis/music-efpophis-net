  <p>This serves as a reprise to Laudate Dominum, and the lyrics are also stolen (mostly) from Mozart. It's another one I remember singing in my high school choir, and so it is also dedicated to my choir teacher, Merrillie Schmidt.</p>

<div class="lyrics">
  <p class="kicker">English Translation:</p>
  Full of tears
  will be that day
  when from ashes shall rise

  The guilty man
  to be judged
  Therefore, spare him
  oh God

  Merciful Lord Jesus
  Grant them eternal rest

  Behold, the lamb of God
  Behold, the lamb of God
  Who takes away the sins of the world

  Merciful Lord Jesus
  Grant them eternal rest

  Amen
