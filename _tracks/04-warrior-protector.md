  <p>The first lines of this song are taken from two separate proverbs: "If you want peace, prepare for war" [si vis pacem, para bellum], and "It's better to be a warrior in a garden than a gardener in a war." I've come to believe that a lot of Christians have gotten pacifism wrong. They think that being peaceful means lacking even the capability of violence. I contend that such a state does not make one peaceful - it only makes one helpless. To be peaceful, I believe one must be capable of violence - great violence if necessary - and choose, of their own free will, not to exercise it. The greatest example of this from scripture that I can think of is Jesus in the garden when the Romans came to arrest him. He, of all people, being also God, was certainly capable of defending himself, and he even said so. He told Peter "Put your sword back in its place, for these things must happen." He did not tell Peter "Get rid of your sword, you shouldn't even have it." This implies that there is a time and place for violence, but only as a last resort and for a righteous cause. This is the philosophy I've adopted and am learning how to emulate.</p>

  <p>To that end, one of my many interests besides music is the study of To Shin Do, an Americanized form of Japanese Ninjitsu. I've been studying it off and on since about 2007, and am finally close to earning my first-degree black belt (there are 10 degrees in To Shin Do). I have studied under a few different teachers over the years, including Keith Kotoshi Copeland, Joel Dentoshi Iverson, and currently my sensei and good friend, Ryan Antoshi Marchand, and his wife Maddie. In addition to holding a 3rd degree black belt, Sensei Ryan is also a skilled guitarist.</p>

  <p>This song was derived from the closing riff of a song Ryan has been working on. The intro and composition are all Ryan's work - no AI there. We recorded it in his home studio using my cell phone placed in front of the output to his awesome amp stack. You can kinda hear the string strikes in the background, even. I was then able to upload that track to the AI and have it generate a full song, with lyrics that I composed.</p>

  <p>Since Sensei Ryan is the only real human artist to play an instrument on this track, he retains full credit and copyright for it. I have included it on this album with his blessing and permission.</p>

  <p>Stay tuned, tho - Sensei is still composing the song from which this riff was taken, and when it's done, we are going to record it and see if we can make something cool - without the AI.</p>

```text
[Verse]
If you seek to live in peace
You must prepare to fight
better a warrior in a garden
than a gardener in a war

[Verse 2]
In the quiet of the night
He moves without a sound
Guarding all that he loves
He stands on solid ground

[Chorus]
Warrior in the shadows
Protector of his own
The power of the ninja
Comes from deep within the soul

[Break]
[Interlude]
[Instrumental: guitar]

[Verse 3]
With every step he takes
The winds begin to change
Whispers in the void
awaken the inner flame

[Bridge]
Hands move like the wind
Immovable as the mountain
He flows like a river
and strikes with the power of the storm

[Chorus]
Warrior in the shadows
Protector of his own
The power of the ninja
Comes from deep within the soul

[Verse 3]
With every step he takes
The winds begin to change
Whispers in the void
awaken the inner flame

[Bridge]
Hands move like the wind
Immovable as the mountain
He flows like a river
and strikes with the power of the storm

[Chorus]
Warrior in the shadows
Protector of his own
The power of the ninja
Comes from deep within the soul

[Bridge]
Hands move like the wind
Immovable as the mountain
He flows like a river
and strikes with the power of the storm

Oh, oh-oh, warrior in the shadows...
