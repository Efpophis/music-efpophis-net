[Verse]
There's an empty lot where my truck used to stay,
She'd drive me through the nights and greet the break of day.
But now I'm standing here, all torn and betrayed,
My self-driving sweetheart, she's up and gone away.

[Verse 2]
I found a note on the garage door, in digital type,
She said she's found another with more battery life.
A smoother ride, more torque in the bends,
I guess my faithful truck has gone and made new friends.

[Chorus]
Oh, lonely roads, where do I go?
When my self-driving truck has left me low.
Bigger charger, newer thrills,
She's speeding off to the Silicon Hills.

[Verse 3]
Remember the miles we shared, just her and me,
From small-town parades to the shining sea.
But those solar panels must've set her free,
Now I'm stuck here just reminiscing with jealousy.

[Bridge]
Her sensors saw a future I couldn't give,
Longer drives, more juice to live.
My heart's on empty, left here to roam,
She found a new owner and left our home.

[Chorus]
Oh, lonely roads, where do I go?
When my self-driving truck has left me low.
Bigger charger, newer thrills,
She's speeding off to the Silicon Hills.
