notes: "Remember when Ska was a thing? I always thought it was a neat idea to have metal with a brass section, and the jubilant celebration described in Isaiah 35 seemed to fit the mood nicely, especially after the previous chapter. God will fix things. Take courage, do not be afraid!"

[Intro]
[Interlude]
[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Let the wilderness and the dry lands exult
Let the desert rejoice and bloom
Let it bring forth flowers like the rose
Let it rejoice and sing for joy

[Verse 2]
The glory of Lebanon is bestowed on it,
The splendor of Carmel and Sharon;
They shall see the glory of Yahweh,
The splendor of our God.

[Bridge]
Strengthen all the weary hands
Steady all the trembling knees
Say to all the fainting hearts,
"Take courage! Do not be afraid!"

[Chorus]
Behold, your God is coming!
Vengeance is coming,
The retribution of God;
He is coming to save you!

[Interlude]
[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened,
The ears of the deaf unsealed,
The lame shall leap like a dear
And the tongues of the mute sing for joy

[Verse 4]
For water gushes in the desert,
Streams flow in the wasteland,
The scorched earth becomes a lake,
In the parched land, springs of water rise

[Bridge]
The dens of jackals and vipers
Become thickets of reed and papyrus

[Chorus]
Behold, your God is coming!
Vengeance is coming,
The retribution of God;
He is coming to save you!

[Interlude]
[Instrumental]

[Bridge]
The dens of jackals and vipers
Become thickets of reed and papyrus

[Chorus]
Behold, your God is coming!
Vengeance is coming,
The retribution of God;
He is coming to save you!
(repeat 1x)

[Interlude]
[Instrumental]

[Verse 5]
And through it all will run a highway
Which shall be called the Sacred Way;
The unclean may not travel on it,
Nor fools stray along it.

[Verse 6]
No lion will prowl there
Nor any fierce beast roam about it,
But the redeemed will walk there,
For those whom Yahweh has ransomed shall return.

[Instrumental]

[Bridge]
They will come to Zion shouting for joy,
With everlasting joy on their faces
Joy and gladness will go with them
And sorrow and lament be ended.

[Chorus]
Behold, your God is coming!
Vengeance is coming,
The retribution of God;
He is coming to save you!
(repeat 1x)

[Ending]
