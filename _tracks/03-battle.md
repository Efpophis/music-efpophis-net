  <p>When Redeemer first formed, circa 1993 or 1994, we had no bassist, no drummer .. just a keyboardist with next to no talent (me), a pretty good singer (Mark Fisher), and a half-decent guitarist (Mark Rounds). Our very first jam session happened in someone's bedroom, where we attempted to play "The Battle Belongs to the Lord" - a hymn that
  had been recently covered by one of our favorite bands, Petra. The experience was interesting, for lack of a better word. But, we realized we were able to stay together pretty well, and there was potential. We quickly began writing our own material, and "Battle Belongs," as we called it, quickly vanished from our catalog.</p>
  <p>I wanted to revive that song and use it for this project, but the lyrics are still under copyright, so I can't use the original version without acquiring a license, and that costs money I'm not willing to spend.</p>

  <p>So, instead, I composed an entirely new "battle" song, drawn from the scriptures, and with a similar lyrical theme, but different enough so that I should avoid any copyright issues.</p>
  
  <p>I also thought, why not go from a nice, mellow ballad in E-minor to an extreme black metal sound? So our very first jam session has, indeed, been resurrected - and completely transformed. It may not melt your face off, but it should at least warm it up a bit.</p>

[Verse 1]
Donning holy armor, we enter the fray
The battle is not ours, it is Yahweh's
No weapon formed against us shall avail
The battle is not ours, it is Yahweh's

[Chorus]
Halelu-yah, glory and power to Yahweh
Halelu-yah, power and strength to our God

[Verse 2]
Darkness covers the land like a flood
The battle is not ours -
His banner raised high, the blood of His Son
The battle is not ours, it is Yahweh's  
Halelu-yah, power and strength to our God

[Verse 3]
Evil prevails for a time, have no fear
The battle is not ours, it is Yahweh's
Trust in his name, your redemption draws near
The battle is not ours, it is Yahweh's

[Chorus]
Halelu-yah, the battle is not ours, it is Yahweh's
Halelu-yah, salvation belongs to Yahweh
Halelu-yah, victory belongs to Yahweh

[Outro]
Halelu-yah, salvation belongs to Yahweh
Halelu-yah, victory belongs to Yahweh
Halelu-yah, victory belongs to Yahweh
Halelu-yah, halelu-yah
