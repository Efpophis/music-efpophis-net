  <p>No Redeemer Project album is complete without taking an ancient hymn and giving it the metal treatment. This was a late addition to this album. One of my friends posted the lyrics to the old hymn "When We All Get to Heaven" and I thought. "you know, this needs a metal cover."</p>

  <p>I was even able to arrange the lyrics so that the AI got the backing vocals mostly right. I think this came out to be a pretty decent banger. Enjoy!</p>

[Verse 1]
Sing the wondrous love of Jesus
Sing His Mercy and His Grace
In the mansions bright and blessed,
He'll prepare for us a place

[Chorus]
When we all (when we all)
Get to heaven, what a day (what a day)
Of rejoicing that will be (of rejoicing that will be)
When we all (when we all) see Jesus
We'll sing and shout the victory (and shout the victory)

[Verse 2]
While we walk the pilgrim pathway
Clouds will overspread the sky
But when traveling days are over
Not a shadow, not a sigh

[Chorus]
When we all (when we all)
Get to heaven, what a day (what a day)
Of rejoicing that will be (of rejoicing that will be)
When we all (when we all) see Jesus
We'll sing and shout the victory (and shout the victory)

[Verse 3]
Let us then be true and faithful
Trusting, serving every day
Just one glimpse of Him in glory
Will the toils of life repay

[Chorus]
When we all (when we all)
Get to heaven, what a day (what a day)
Of rejoicing that will be (of rejoicing that will be)
When we all (when we all) see Jesus
We'll sing and shout the victory (and shout the victory)

[Verse 4]
Onward to the prize before us!
Soon His beauty we'll behold;
Soon the pearly gates will open,
We shall tread the streets of gold

[Chorus]
When we all (when we all)
Get to heaven, what a day (what a day)
Of rejoicing that will be (of rejoicing that will be)
When we all (when we all) see Jesus
We'll sing and shout the victory (and shout the victory)

[Outro]
When we all (when we all)
Get to heaven, what a day (what a day)
Of rejoicing that will be (of rejoicing that will be)
When we all (when we all) see Jesus
We'll sing and shout the victory (and shout the victory)

[Ending]
SHOUT THE VICTORY!!
