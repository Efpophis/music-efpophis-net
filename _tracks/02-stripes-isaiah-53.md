notes: |
  <p>Stripes is a very early Redeemer song, and the original lyrics have, unfortunately, been lost to time and the obsolescence of the media on which they were stored many years ago. </p>

  <p>However, a fresh reading of Isaiah 53 brought back what I think is a good approximation.</p>

  <p>The song focuses on the substitutionary death of Jesus Christ and its direct consequences of cleansing our sins and healing the spiritual sickness unto which all mankind is subject because of those sins.</p>

  <p>You'll notice I specifically didn't mention Jesus by name in any of these verses. Also, only the bridge references anything from the New Testament at all. And yet, you probably knew exactly who I was talking about. Now, consider this: most of these words were spoken by a prophet who lived centuries BEFORE Jesus was born.</p>

[Verse 1]
Who could believe what we have heard?
To whom is the power of God revealed?
Only to those who live by faith alone
And trust in the power of Yahweh

[Verse 2]
He was despised and rejected,
A man of sorrows, a friend of grief
But the stone the builders rejected
Is now the capstone of our faith

[Chorus]
He was wounded for our transgressions
Bruised for our iniquities
On Him, the sentence that brings us peace
And by His stripes we're healed
And by His stripes we're healed

[Verse 3]
Like sheep, we have all gone astray
Each one following his own way
But God has laid upon Him
The iniquity of us all

[Verse 4]
But His soul was not left in hell,
Nor did His body suffer decay
He bore the sins of all the world
And left them all in the grave

[Chorus]
He was wounded for our transgressions
Bruised for our iniquities
On Him, the sentence that brings us peace
And by his stripes we're healed
And by his stripes we're healed
And by his stripes we're healed

[Bridge]
The scriptures told us Messiah must suffer
And be raised to life on the third day
Foolishness to those who perish, they say
But the power of God to the saved
How the soul must be saved

[Chorus]
He was wounded for our transgressions
Bruised for our iniquities
On Him, the sentence that brings us peace
And by his stripes we're healed
And by his stripes we're healed
And by his stripes we're healed
