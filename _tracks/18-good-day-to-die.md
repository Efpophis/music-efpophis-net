notes: |
  <p>Well, you knew it was coming.</p>

  <p>No Redeemer Project album is complete without a Klingon Death Metal track, and here it is. This time, I actually composed all of the Klingon lyrics myself (with the help of a translator). The AI helped a little bit with the English, but not much.</p>

  <p>All of the Klingon is translated in-song, except for the bridge, which translates roughly to "Stovokor awaits! Glory to the Empire!"</p>

  <p>Stovokor, as we all know, is the Klingon version of heaven, tho it sounds more like Valhalla - the home of honored warriors who have died in battle.</p>

[Verse 1]
Skies ablaze as doom descends
Breath of fire brings fate's decree
Kahless' blood runs in my veins!!
Unrelenting, hear the battle cry!

[Verse 2]
Mountains weep and oceans boil
Spilled the blood of mighty foes
The warrior's doom is now in sight
Today, damnation takes its flight!

[Bridge]
Stovokor, jI'Hegh!
ba'la jIlop puj'a'

[Chorus]
qorDu' tlhIngan qun (for the glory of Kronos)
qeylIS batlh wejpuH (the great honor of Kahless)
ghu'vetlh luSopchu'DI' (for the power of the Empire)
Heghlu'meH QaQ jajvam!

[Verse 3]
Iron will and heart of stone
Rivers flow with blood and bone
The warrior's heart, the devil's bane
His final breath gives no disdain

[Verse 4]
Mountains weep and oceans boil
Spilled the blood of mighty foes
The warrior's doom is now in sight
Today, damnation takes its flight!

[Bridge]
Stovokor, jI'Hegh!
ba'la jIlop puj'a'

[Chorus]
qorDu' tlhIngan qun (for the glory of Kronos)
qeylIS batlh wejpuH (the great honor of Kahless)
ghu'vetlh luSopchu'DI' (for the power of the Empire)
Heghlu'meH QaQ jajvam!

[Chorus]
qorDu' tlhIngan qun (for the glory of Kronos)
qeylIS batlh wejpuH (the great honor of Kahless)
ghu'vetlh luSopchu'DI' (for the power of the Empire)
Heghlu'meH QaQ jajvam!

[Shouted] TODAY IS A GOOD DAY TO DIE!

[Verse 5]
Iron will and heart of stone
Rivers flow with blood and bone
The warrior's heart, the devil's bane
His final breath gives no disdain

[Chorus]
qorDu' tlhIngan qun 
qeylIS batlh wejpuH 
ghu'vetlh luSopchu'DI' (for the power of the Empire)
Heghlu'meH QaQ jajvam!

[Chorus]
qorDu' tlhIngan qun (for the glory of Kronos)
qeylIS batlh wejpuH (the great honor of Kahless)
ghu'vetlh luSopchu'DI' (for the power of the Empire)
Heghlu'meH QaQ jajvam!

[Shouted] TODAY IS A GOOD DAY TO DIE!
