```text
Please rise for our national anthem ....

[Verse]
Oh say, can you see
By the dawn's early light
What so proudly we hailed
At the twilight's last gleaming

[Verse]
Who's broad stripes and bright stars
through the perilous night
o'er the ramparts we watched
were so gallantly streaming

[Bridge]
And the rockets' red glare
the bombs bursting in air
gave proof through the night
that our flag was still there

[Chorus]
Oh say, does that star-spangled banner yet wave
O'er the land of the free
and the home of the brave?

[Verse]
Who's broad stripes and bright stars
through the perilous night
o'er the ramparts we watched
were so gallantly streaming

[Bridge]
And the rockets' red glare
the bombs bursting in air
gave proof through the night
that our flag was still there

was still there
oooo-aah!

[Chorus]
Oh say, does that star-spangled banner yet wave
O'er the land of the free
and the home of the brave?
