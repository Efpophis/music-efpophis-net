notes: "This track is taken directly from Psalm 150 in its (more or less) original Hebrew text. I did arrange some of the Halleluyahs to make for a more modern structure and flow. For this, I wanted traditional Middle Eastern instruments and scales, but with a modern metal twist. I think it came out great."
