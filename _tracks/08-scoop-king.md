[Intro]
[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Lil homie rollin' down the block with a scoop in his hand,
Neighborhood cheerin', he's the scoopin' man,
Anything he sees, he wants it in the pan,
From pasta to dog food, he scoops what he can.

[Verse 2]
Caught him on the corner, gravel in the bucket,
Mama says, "Why you scoopin'?" He ain't gonna duck it,
Scoops the beans and the beads, even grabs the muck,
From sunrise to sunset, he's the scoopin' buck.

[Bridge]
Scoop dreamin', ain't no limit to his reach,
Scoopin' up the sand right off the beach,
Lifes a hustle, and scoopin' be his preach,
In this concrete jungle, scoops are what he teach.

[Chorus]
He's a scoop king, everything a treasure,
From the beach to the streets, scoopin' for pleasure,
No one does it better, he's a natural hustler,
Knows the value of the scoop, like a seasoned baller.

[Interlude]
[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
Found him at the ballpark, scooping up the clay,
People lookin' puzzled, but it's his kinda play,
If you drop some change, best believe it's in his tray,
Scoopin' up the world, in his own special way.

[Verse 4]
From the alleys to the yards, he got that scoopin' swag,
Scoops up a pine cone, toss it in his bag,
Every day's an adventure, scooping like a tag,
Little homie on a mission, never gonna lag.

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

[Interlude]
[Instrumental]

[Verse 5]
Lil' homie scoop the world, never slip or falter,
Ice cream, diggin' gold, ain't nothin' he won't alter,
Small hands, mad plans, like a young boss man,
Scoopin' dreams, no seams, without a hitch or hand.

[Verse 6]
Sandbox tales, scoopin' dirt and diamonds,
Action figures, buried treasure, timeless,
Playground kingpin, lord of the sands,
Scoopin' every chance, with precision in his hands.

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Scoop dreams, on the rise, no disguise,
Scooping life in his eyes, never compromise,
From the dollar bills to the sandcastles high,
Scoop king, living life, so fly.

[Outro]
He's a scoop king, everything a treasure,
From the beach to the streets, scoopin' for pleasure,
No one does it better, he's a natural hustler,
Knows the value of the scoop, like a seasoned baller.

[Ending]
