[Verse 1]
Hark! the herald angels sing,
"Glory to the newborn King:
Peace on earth, and mercy mild,
God and sinners reconciled!"

Joyful, all you nations, rise,
Join the triumph of the skies;
With the angelic hosts proclaim,
"Christ is born in Bethlehem!"

[Chrous]
Hark! the herald angels sing,
"Glory to the newborn King"

[Interlude]
[Instrumental: guitar]

[Verse 2]
Christ, by highest Heaven, adored,
Christ, the everlasting LORD,
Late in time behold Him come,
Offspring of the Virgin's womb:

Veiled in flesh, the Godhead see;
Hail the incarnate Deity,
Pleased as man with men to dwell,
Jesus, our Emmanuel. 

[Chorus]

[Interlude]
[Instrumenatl: guitar]

[Verse 3]
Hail the heaven-born Prince of Peace!
Hail the Son of Righteousness!
Light and life to all He brings,
Risen with healing in His wings.

Mild, He lays His glory by,
Born that we no more may die,
Born to raise us from the Earth,
Born to give us second birth.

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Hark! the herald angels sing,
Glory to the newborn king
