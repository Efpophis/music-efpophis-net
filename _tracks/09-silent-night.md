notes: |
  <p>Silent Night has already been done as a speed/thrash metal tune by a great band called Deliverance.</p>
  <p>I took it to an even greater extreme and made it black metal, and it works surprisingly well.</p>

[Verse 1]
Silent night, holy night
All is calm, all is bright
'Round yon virgin, mother and child
Holy infant, so tender and mild

[Scream]
Sleep in heavenly peace (sleep in peace)
Sleep in heavenly peace (sleep in peace)

[Verse 2]
Silent Night, holy night
Shepherds quake at the sight
Glories stream from Heaven afar
Heavenly hosts sing, "alleluia!"

[Scream]
Christ, the Saviour is born (Christ is born)
Christ, the Saviour is born (Christ is born)

BLEAGH!!

[Verse 3]
Silent night, holy night
Son of God, Love's pure light
Radiant beams from Your holy face
With the dawn of redeeming grace

[Scream]
Jesus, Lord at your birth (Jesus is lord)
Jesus, Lord at your birth (Jesus is lord)
