  <p>Lyrics by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, 1780, which date puts them solidly in the public domain.</p>

  <p>I remember singing Mozart's version of this in my high school choir. My dear friend sang the first verse as a solo and it was amazing. I still have that performance on a cassette tape somewhere... </p>

  <p>I always wanted to take the lyrics and make something cool out of it. FAR too many years later, here it is, performed in a busy medieval tavern by the local fair maiden.</p>

  <p>Merrillie Schmidt and Julie Fofana - this is for you.</p>

[Verse]
Laudate Dominum, omnes gentes
Laudate Eum, omnes populi
Quoniam confirmata est
Super nos misericordia eius

[Bridge]
Et veritas (et veritas)
veritas Domini
manet in, manet in aeternum

[Chorus]
Gloria Patri et Filio
Et Spiritui Sancto
Sicut erat in principio
Et nunc, et semper
Et in saecula saeculorum

[Outro]
Amen, Amen 
Amen, Amen
```

  <p class="kicker">English Translation:</p>
Praise the LORD,
all nations
Praise Him,
all you peoples
Because it was confirmed
His Mercy
Is Upon us
  
And the truth
The LORD's truth
remains
remains forever
  
Glory to the Father and to the Son
And to the Holy Spirit
As it was in the beginning,
now and always
and forever and ever
Amen, amen, amen, amen
