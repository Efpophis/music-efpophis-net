  <p>One evening, I was having trouble with Suno, the AI application I used to generate my stuff. Suno had just undergone a major upgrade, and the new version was ... let's be nice say it was not meeting anyone's expectations at the time. I visited the Discord chat dedicated to the app for assistance. Eventually, the conversation came around to the topic of interesting or weird things one can do with the AI. One of them was that, if you specified the music style as "extreme scat horror," the AI would happily read any text you gave it fast, and with a decent heavy-metal backing. One guy suggested a recipe for pancakes, for example. So, naturally, I had to try it.</p>
  <p>I copy-pasted Revelation 13, the entire chapter, from the NIV translation and off we went. This track is the result, plus a little post-production tweaking - mainly the echoes at the end. I'm all for apocalyptic metal, so why not?</p>

[Intro]
[Instrumental]

The dragon stood on the shore of the sea. And I saw a beast coming 
out of the sea. It had ten horns and seven heads, with ten crowns 
on its horns, and on each head a blasphemous name. 

The beast I saw resembled a leopard, but had feet like those 
of a bear and a mouth like that of a lion. The dragon gave the 
beast his power and his throne and great authority. 

One of the heads of the beast seemed to have had a fatal wound,
but the fatal wound had been healed. The whole world was filled with
wonder and followed the beast. People worshiped the dragon because
he had given authority to the beast, and they also worshiped the beast
and asked, “Who is like the beast? Who can wage war against it?”

The beast was given a mouth to utter proud words and blasphemies and
to exercise its authority for forty-two months. It opened its mouth to
blaspheme God, and to slander his name and his dwelling place and those
who live in heaven.

It was given power to wage war against God’s holy people and to conquer
them. And it was given authority over every tribe, people, language and
nation. All inhabitants of the earth will worship the beast — all whose 
names have not been written in the Lamb’s book of life, the Lamb who 
was slain from the creation of the world.

Whoever has ears, let them hear.

“If anyone is to go into captivity,
    into captivity they will go.
If anyone is to be killed with the sword,
    with the sword they will be killed.”

This calls for patient endurance and faithfulness on the part of 
God’s people.

Then I saw a second beast, coming out of the earth. It had two horns 
like a lamb, but it spoke like a dragon. It exercised all the authority 
of the first beast on its behalf, and made the earth and its inhabitants 
worship the first beast, whose fatal wound had been healed. 

And it performed great signs, even causing fire to come down from heaven 
to the earth in full view of the people. Because of the signs it was given 
power to perform on behalf of the first beast, it deceived the inhabitants 
of the earth. It ordered them to set up an image in honor of the beast who
was wounded by the sword and yet lived.

The second beast was given power to give breath to the image of the first 
beast, so that the image could speak and cause all who refused to worship 
the image to be killed. It also forced all people, great and small, rich 
and poor, free and slave, to receive a mark on their right hands or on their 
foreheads, so that they could not buy or sell unless they had the mark, 
which is the name of the beast or the number of its name.

[Instrumental]

This calls for wisdom. Let the person who has insight calculate the number 
of the beast, for it is the number of a man. That number is 
six hundred and sixty six.

[Ending]
Six hundred and sixty six
Six hundred and sixty six
Six hundred and sixty six
