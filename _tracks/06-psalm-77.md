notes: |
  <p>Everyone, even God's most devoted servants including the one who wrote this psalm, goes through times when it feels like God has rejected and abandoned them. This psalm was written to express that profound level of grief that keeps you awake all night wondering why you deserve this. It is for the person dealing with a tragedy whose prayers consist mainly of "What the hell, God??" and "Why???" I've been there too often myself. It's awful, and the only way out is through.</p>

  <p>The important thing is that even if you're angry and upset with God, even if you feel He has abandoned you completely .. don't hold it in. It's better to yell and complain and tell God how angry you are with Him than it is to not talk to Him at all.</p>

[Intro]
[Instrumental]
I cry to God in anguish
I cry to God and He hears me.

[Verse 1]
In my day of distress, I sought the LORD.
All through the night, I stretched out my hands
And my soul refused to be consoled.
I sigh as I think of God, my spirit fades
As I ponder Him.

[Verse 2]
You kept me from closing my eyes,
I was too distraught to even speak!
I thought of former times,
I remembered the years gone by

[Bridge]
Through the night I ponder in my heart.
As I reflect, my soul begs the question:

[Chorus]
Is Yahweh's rejection final?
Will He ever show grace again?
Is His faithful love gone forever?
Has His word gone silent for all time?
Does God forget to show mercy?
In anger, is His compassion lost?

[Interlude]
[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
This is the source of my wounds,
The hand of God has lost its strength.
I remember all Your miracles,
I remember Your wonders from the past
I reflect on all you've done for me, I ponder all your deeds.

[Verse 4]
God, your ways are holy! What god is as great as Yahweh?
You are the God who works miracles,
All the nations confess your power
By your hand, you redeem your people,
The children of Jacob and Joseph.

[Bridge]
Through the night I ponder in my heart.
As I reflect, my soul begs the question:

[Chorus]
Is Yahweh's rejection final?
Will He ever show grace again?
Is His faithful love gone forever?
Has His word gone silent for all time?
Does God forget to show mercy?
In anger, is His compassion lost?

[Interlude]
[Instrumental]

[Verse 5]
When the waters saw you, oh God,
When the waters saw you, they writhed in anguish
The very depths shook with fear.
The clouds wept, the thunder roared
Your lightning lit the world, the earth trembled and shook.

[Bridge]
Through the night I ponder in my heart.
As I reflect, my soul begs the question:

[Chorus]
Is Yahweh's rejection final?
Will He ever show grace again?
Is His faithful love gone forever?
Has His word gone silent for all time?
Does God forget to show mercy?
In anger, is His compassion lost?

[Outro]
[Instrumental]

[Ending]
