notes: |
  <p>The psalms were mostly written as songs, and many were performed as such, with instruments and everything. While I'm sure the original Hebrew words fit very well with Hebrew musical structure and rhythms, their English translations usually don't. This hindered my desire to take a single psalm and make it a song with English words on its own. So, I did the next best thing - I cobbled together passages and concepts from several of them to make my own "New Song." The irony is, of course, that it's actually very old.</p>

  <p>The scriptures tell a story of how one of King David's psalms was so lively that the king danced so hard before God that his clothes fell off, and he continued dancing, presumably naked, literally in front of God and everybody! Perhaps David was the original metalhead...</p>

[Verse]
Let all in heaven be glad, let the earth rejoice
let the sea thunder and all it holds
let the fields exult and all that is in them
let the trees in the forest cry out for joy

[Verse]
A fire goes before him
consuming the enemies of God
His lightning illuminates the world
The earth trembles and quakes

[Hook]
Give thanks to Yahweh with the guitar
play with all your heart and skill
Sing a new song to honor Him

[Chorus]
Sing to Yahweh a new song!
Sing to Yahweh, all the earth!
Sing to Yahweh, bless his name!

[Verse]
The mountains melt like wax
in the presence of the King of Kings
The heavens proclaim His justice
All the nations see his glory

[Verse]
Yahweh is a king who loves justice
Yahweh is king, let the nations tremble
Yahweh comes to judge the earth
Holy is Yahweh, our God and salvation

[Hook]
Give thanks to Yahweh with the guitar
play with all your heart and skill
Sing a new song to honor Him

[Chorus]
Sing to Yahweh a new song!
Sing to Yahweh, all the earth!
Sing to Yahweh, bless his name!

[Bridge]
Yahweh is God, and He is good
His love endures forever
His faithfulness endures forever

[Hook]
Give thanks to Yahweh with the drum and bass
play with all your heart and skill
Sing a new song to honor Him

[Chorus]
Sing to Yahweh a new song!
Sing to Yahweh, all the earth!
Sing to Yahweh, bless his name!
