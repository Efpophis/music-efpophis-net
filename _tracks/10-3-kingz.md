[Verse 1]
We, three kings of Orient are
Bearing gifts, we traverse afar
Field and fountain, moor and mountain
Following yonder star

[Chorus]
Oh, oh, star of wonder, star of night
Star of royal beauty bright
Westward leading, still proceeding
Guide us to thy perfect light

[Verse 2]
Born a king on Bethlehem's plain
Gold, I bring, to crown Him again
King forever, ceasing never
Over us all to reign

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Frankincense to offer have I
Incense owns a Deity nigh
Prayer and praising, all men raising
Worship Him, God, most high

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
Myrrh have I, its bitter perfume
Breathes a life of gathering doom
Sorrowing, sighing, bleeding, dying
Sealed in a stone-cold tomb

[Chorus]

[Verse 5]
Glorious now, behold Him arise
King and God and sacrifice
Halleluyah, halleluyah
Earth to the Heavens replies

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Oh, oh, star of wonder, star of night
Star of royal beauty bright
Westward leading, still proceeding
Guide us to thy perfect light
