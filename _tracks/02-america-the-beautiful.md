```text
[Verse 1]
O beautiful for spacious skies,
for amber waves of grain;
for purple mountain majesties
above the fruited plain!

[Refrain]
America! America! God shed his grace on thee,
and crown thy good with brotherhood
from sea to shining sea.

[Verse 2]
O beautiful for heroes proved
in liberating strife,
who more than self their country loved,
and mercy more than life!

[Refrain]
America! America! May God thy gold refine,
till all success be nobleness,
and every gain divine.

[Verse 3]
O beautiful for patriot dream
that sees beyond the years
thine alabaster cities gleam,
undimmed by human tears!

[Refrain]
America! America! God mend thine every flaw,
confirm thy soul in self-control,
thy liberty in law

[Outro]
America! America! God shed his grace on thee
and crown thy good with brotherhood
from sea to shining sea
from sea to shining sea
```
