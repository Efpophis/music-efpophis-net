  <p>This is based on several passages from the book of Revelation. I just like the lyrics and the themes of worship and God's supremacy they present. I admit to ripping off the Halelujah Chorus from Handel's Messiah, but only a little bit.</p>

  <p>I'd also like to thank the band HolyName for their unique style of metal worship. I think this song sounds like something they would do, so I am calling it a tribute to that excellent band.</p>

```text
[Verse 1]
I saw a multitude 
clothed in white
The saints reborn
redeemed of all the nations
The true Bride of Christ
the children of light
Saved by grace 
received by faith

[Verse 2]
They kneel in unison
before the throne
Their prayers rise like incense
their praise like sweet perfume
Like thunder before the LORD
rejoicing in His name
The sound rises to new heights
Heaven and Earth tremble at the sight

[Verse 3]
they sing a new song
yet one so very old
The song of Moses, the servant of God
And the song of the Lamb

[Chorus]
saying, Great and marvelous are Your deeds
Oh Yahweh, God Almighty 
holy is Your name (holy)
Just and true are all Your ways
Oh King of all the nations
Who shall not fear You
and glorify Your name?
For You alone are holy (you are holy)
Your Righteousness is now revealed

[Verse 4]
The kingdoms of this world 
oh, the kingdoms of this world
have become the kingdoms of our God 
and of His Christ, and of His Christ
And He shall reign forever
And He shall reign forever and ever and ever

[Verse 5]
For God has come to dwell among His people
There will be no temple, no sanctuary
No gates, no veil, no wall (no wall), no barrier
And all shall praise Him, day and night

[Chorus]
saying, Great and marvelous are Your deeds
Oh Yahweh, God Almighty 
holy is Your name (holy holy)
Just and true are all Your ways
Oh King of all the nations
Who shall not fear You and glorify Your name?
For You alone are holy (you are holy)
Your Righteousness is now revealed

[Outro]
and He shall reign forever and ever!
and He shall reign forever and ever!
forever and ever, forever and ever!
[Repeat]
