notes: |
  <p>Psalm 23 has long been a favorite of many, and there are many musicians who have successfully set it to music - Deliverance being my favorite.</p>

  <p>This version came about when I was fiddling around with the AI and wondered if it could present a reggae tune with metal overtones. I unknowingly created something along the lines of a Matisyahu song, tho at the time I had never heard of him. Still, I am going to call this a Matisyahu tribute because I never thought I would hear, let alone enjoy, Jewish Reggae music, yet here we are.</p>

```text
[Verse 1]
In the valley of madness
I and I walk through the night
With the weight of my sins
My soul in a constant fight
But I shall fear no evil
For Jah light my way
With His rod and staff to guide me, I'll never stray

[Chorus]
Oh Jah
My shepherd watching from on high
Let your presence guide my way
Through the valleys and shadows
Your word will be my light
I And I fear no evil, for you are with me
You are with me

[Verse 2]
On green pastures, I and I tread
With no fear in my heart
even tho the demons inside
Try to tear me apart
'cause Jah love is my shield
My refuge and my strength
And in His mighty power, I and I trust
I completely trust

[Chorus]
Let your presence guide my way
Through the valleys and shadows
Your word will be my light
I and I fear no evil, for you are with me
You are with me

[Verse 3]
You set a table before me
in the presence of my enemies
you anoint my head with holy oil
my cup of blessings is overflowin'
surely, Jah goodness and mercy follow me, all the days of my life
and I will live in the house of Jah, forever and ever and ever amen!

[Chorus]
Let your presence guide my way
Through the valleys and shadows
Your word will be my light
I and I fear no evil, for you are with me
You are with me

[Chorus]
Oh Jah
My shepherd watching from on high
Let your presence guide my way
Through the valleys and shadows
Your word will be my light
I and I fear no evil, for you are with me
You are with me

[Chorus]
Oh Jah
My shepherd watching from on high
Let your presence guide my way
Through the valleys and shadows
Your word will be my light
I and I fear no evil, for you are with me
You are with me
