notes: |
   <p>This is heavily inspired by a praise song, but again, significantly modified by me to, among other things, avoid copyright issues. I've also added some ideas, and introduced the liberal use of the Divine Name Yahweh in place of the more traditional Adonai/LORD. I've come to believe that God is very much ok with us actually using, in an appropriate way, the name He gave us to use to invoke and praise Him. He will ultimately judge.</p>

   <p>The band's original version was played live once, on a whim. If I remember right, we ran out of material before the next band was ready. So, I basically improvised this whole thing with just my keyboard and voice. As simple as it was, it was an unforgettable experience, and it turned out to be a pretty good ending for our set.</p>

   <p>When reviving this song, I was initially thinking to record my voice singing it a capella several different ways, and then mix them all together. Before doing that, though, I decided to let my trusty AI friend have a crack at it, and Mr. Microchips did NOT disappoint! This turned out to be an absolute banger, and probably one of my favorite worship songs ever. I can only hope God enjoys listening to it as much or more than I do.</p>

<hr>*I found out after the fact that the Hebrew here is .. not quite right. It should probably be "ha'sha ha'yah" for "He who was". But, the way I have it IS exactly how I learned it from a Christian Jew who at least claimed he knew some Hebrew. I like the rest of the song way too much to toss it out, so I'm going to chalk this up to maybe it was an ancient word that's changed pronunciation or something like that. I certainly didn't intend to say anything about teeth, which is what I think "naya" actually means in modern Hebrew.  Oops.
