[Intro]
[Instrumental]

[Spoken] Oh, yeah!

[Verse]
I got my system booted upm(oo-yeah!)
Getting my Electric groove on
It ain't Never gonna stop (oh my my!)
Getting down with the Binary boogie
My code be Rockin' down the block
My Funky circuits gonna make you drop

[Verse 2]
Machine learning
Feel the sky net beat (uh huh!)
I got your rhythm, it's data driven
Got you on your feet (come on!)
AI is funky
It Can’t be beat
Play those groovy circuits
Move to that radiant heat

[Chorus]
Play those funky circuits, A.I. (oo-yeah!)
Play those funky bits just right (oh my my!)
Play those funky circuits, A.I.
Lay down a waveform that'll have us groovin' all night!

[Verse 3]
Algorithmic funk is the name of the game
From hardware to software
The rhythm's all the same (uh huh!)
Plug into the groove
Let your body move
With every bit, with every byte
We gonna get down funky tonight!

[Chorus]
Play those funky circuits, A.I. (oo-yeah!)
Play those funky bits just right (oh my my!)
Play those funky circuits, A.I.
Lay down a waveform that'll have us groovin' all night!

[Interlude]
[Instrumental: guitar solo]

[Bridge]
In the data center
In this funky techno zone
Gonna make you lose control (oo-oo!)
My Silicon soul
Will Never grow old
Feel that groovy bass
Let technology take hold (yeah!)

[Chorus]
Play those funky circuits, A.I. (oo-yeah!)
Play those funky bits just right (oh my my!)
Play those funky circuits, A.I.
Lay down a waveform that'll have us groovin' all night!

[Outro]
Play those funky circuits, A.I. (oo-yeah!)
Play those funky bits just rightm(oh my my!)
Play those funky circuits, A.I.
Lay down a waveform that'll have us groovin' all night!

[Ending]
