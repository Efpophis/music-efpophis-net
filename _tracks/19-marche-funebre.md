notes: "While the Marche Funebre is not technically part of the Requiem Mass, per se, I thought it would be an appropriate ending to this album. It's supposed to be an instrumental metal dirge. It is inspired heavily by a song of the same title by Candlemass, which they, in turn, stole from Chopin."
