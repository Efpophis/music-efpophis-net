  <p>I don't even like rap, what's this doing here??</p>
  <p>I just wanted to see if the AI could make a decent gangsta-rap song with Christian lyrics. I was not disappointed.</p>

[Verse 1]
In the dark alleyways, where pain is the norm
An ice-cold killer, my soul tattered and torn
I walked through the streets, burdened by my past
Searching for a way out, a chance to make it last

With a heart full of anger, and a mind full of schemes
I played the game of life, caught up in the streets
But one night, something shifted in my weary soul
I heard a voice calling, a chance to make me whole

[Verse 2]
I met a preacher man, with a holy book in hand
Who spoke of redemption, of a new promised land
Tears filled my eyes, soaked in my past mistakes
I knew I had to change, for my soul's own sake

[Pre-Chorus]
Baptized in the fire, I rose up from the dirt
A sinner on these streets, that's where I proved my worth
But I found myself lost, I needed a new birth
Searching for redemption, I found it in a church

[Chorus]
Now I'm walking with Jesus, he's my guiding light
No more running from the darkness that haunted my nights
I'm preaching on these corners, sharing the good news
Turning heads with my rhymes and changing souls, that's the life I choose
I found truth

[Verse 3]
From gangsta to believer, the transformation is real
I traded in my gat for a Bible, that's the deal
No more hustling street corners, no more chasing thrills
I found my purpose in Christ, He's where my heart dwells

[Pre-Chorus]
Baptized in the fire, I rose up from the dirt
A sinner on these streets, that's where I proved my worth
But I found myself lost, I needed a new birth
Searching for redemption, I found it in a church

[Chorus]
Now I'm walking with Jesus, he's my guiding light
No more running from the darkness that haunted my nights
I'm preaching on these corners, sharing the good news
Turning heads with my rhymes and changing souls, that's the life I choose
I found truth
