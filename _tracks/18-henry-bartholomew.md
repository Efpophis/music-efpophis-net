[Intro]
[Spoken] well .. we got another dog.

Oooo, wah! ah! ah! ah!
[Instrumental]

WOOF!  WOOF!

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
He's a wrecking ball with paws
He's Bouncin' off the walls
He's got a 
White coat with a buncha brown spots
He's almost as smart as half a box of rocks

[Verse 2]
Fool fell off the couch again
Still waggin' his tail cuz he’s my best friend
Chasing the cat like a shot in the dark
Bro's gonna realize that darn thing's sharp!

[Short interlude]

[Chorus]
Well, Hank's got heart, but he's dumb as a stone
He'll chew his own tail 'cause he thinks it's a bone
He's got clumsy feet, but he’s my king
He's a gentle soul, but he's built like a tank
Such a dopey dog, don't know his own strength

[Interlude]
[Instrumental]

Oooo, wah! ah! ah! ah!
WOOF! WOOF!

[Verse 3]
Eyes like two marbles, they're bright but blank
Drool like a faucet, and smells his own stank
Every move’s a disaster zone
But Hank don’t care, cause this is his home

[Verse 4]
Tried to jump the fence
But hit the floor, then he
Knocked over a lamp and
Broke down the door
He’s a walking trainwreck
And a howling storm
But he's a good boy
He's such a good boy!

[Prechorus]
Crash
Fall
Bark
Repeat
Big love
Big mess
Big heartbeat

oooo, wah! ah! ah! ah!

[Chorus]
Well, Hank's got heart, but he's dumb as a stone
He'll chew his own tail 'cause he thinks it's a bone
He's got clumsy feet, but he’s my king
He's a gentle soul, but he's built like a tank
Such a dopey dog, don't know his own strength

[Interlude]
[Instrumental]
[brutal breakdown]

[Outro]
Well, Hank's got heart, but he's dumb as a stone
He'll chew his own tail 'cause he thinks it's a bone
He's got clumsy feet, but he’s my king
He's a gentle soul, but he's built like a tank
Such a dopey dog, don't know his own strength

But he's a good boy
Yeah, he's such a good boy

[Ending]
