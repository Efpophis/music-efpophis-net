```text
[Verse 1]
Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord;
He is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored;
He hath loosed the fateful lightning of his terrible swift sword:
His truth is marching on.

[Refrain]
Glory! Glory! Hallelujah!
Glory! Glory! Hallelujah!
Glory! Glory! Hallelujah!
His truth is marching on.

[Verse 2]
I have seen him in the watch-fires of a hundred circling camps;
They have builded him an altar in the evening dews and damps;
I can read the righteous sentence by the dim and flaring lamps;
His day is marching on. 

[Refrain]

[Verse 3]
He has sounded forth the trumpet that shall never call retreat;
He is sifting out the hearts of all before his judgment seat;
O be swift, my soul, to answer him; be jubilant, my feet!
Our God is marching on. 

[Refrain]

[Verse 4]
In the beauty of the lilies Christ was born across the sea,
With a glory in his bosom that transfigures you and me;
As he died to make us holy, let us live to make all free!
While God is marching on. 

[Outro]
Glory, Glory, Hallelujah!
Oh Glory, Glory, Hallelujah!
Glory, Glory, Hallelujah!
His truth is marching on!
His truth is marching on!!!
Yeah!
```
