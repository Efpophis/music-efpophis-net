  <p>I wanted to do a blues tune for a couple of reasons:</p>

  <p>First, I wanted to see if I could get the AI to actually follow a complex-ish structure. It did.</p>

  <p>But, mostly so I could dedicate it to my former boss, Pete Neumann, who passed away on October 13, 2019. Pete was an awesome person to work for, and he hired me into the best company I've ever worked for and wherefrom I hope to retire one day. He was also a skilled guitarist and loved the blues. I picture Pete's area of heaven being a haze-filled hole-in-the-wall where he's hanging out with his angelic band, cranking out the riffs and loving every minute. This one's for you, Pete - maybe we can jam together when I get there someday.</p>
