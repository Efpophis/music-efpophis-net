  <p>Traditionally, only the men of the choir would sing this. So it's raucous, loud, and in your face. Just like a bunch of teenage boys.</p>

  <p>The song dates back to the 13th century, and no one really knows who originally composed it.</p>

[Chorus]
This great day, I met upon the way,
The Kings of East as they came riding proudly,
This great day, I met upon the way,
The Kings of East with all their fine array.

[Verse]
The gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh
Were guarded close by a band of sturdy warriors,
Their swords, their shields, and their bucklers bright,
A-gleam and sparkling in the morning light.

[Chorus]
This great day, I met upon the way,
The Kings of East as they came riding proudly,
This great day, I met upon the way,
The Kings of East with all their fine array.
