[Intro]
[Instrumental]

[verse 1]
Do you know what a hard drive is?
Eight hours to New Jersey to meet a girl
And then you find out she's ugly as sin
And you're really not interested at all

[Interlude - short]

[Spoken] I just wanna go home [hacking cough noise]

[Bridge]
To Aaron is human ...
But to really Chuck things up
You need a computer

[Chorus - super heavy]
Are you sick of me yet? [hacking cough noise]
Are you sick of me yet? [hacking cough noise]
Are you sick of me yet? [hacking cough noise]
Are you sick of me yet? [hacking cough noise]

[verse 2]
Hey kid, you ever dance with the devil
By the pale moonlight?
No, but I've written FORTRAN on a VAX
Does that count?

[Interlude - short]

[Spoken] Will that even compile?  [hacking cough noise]

[Bridge]
To Aaron is human
But to really Chuck things up
You need a computer

[Brutal breakdown]

[Chorus - super heavy]
Are you sick of me yet? [hacking cough noise]
Are you sick of me yet? [hacking cough noise]
Are you sick of me yet? [hacking cough noise]
Are you sick of me yet? [hacking cough noise]

[Outro]
[Spoken] It's pronounced Mon Jello

[Instrumental]

[spoken] yeah ...
