  <p>Yes, it's another version of Amazing Grace.</p>

  <p>This came about for 2 reasons. First, Suno received an upgrade where you can upload your own audio file and it will create a full song based on that. So, I tried it with a recording of myself singing, and the result was <a href="/tracks/16-pie-jesu">Pie Jesu</a> from <a href="/albums/requiem-ex-mortis">Requiem Ex Mortis</a>. I noticed that, when given my voice, the AI tends to produce some pretty nice bass vocals. This is to be expected since I have always sung bass - but it does a REALLY good job at it, I think. Second, I was inspired by those "deep bass covers" you can find on YouTube and wanted to see if I could make a few of my own with the AI. So, since Pie Jesu came out more metal and less bass-y in the end, I decided to try again with some lyrics I knew I could sing well - and that happened to be Amazing Grace. So, this version is VERY different from the "old school thrash metal" version on Death and Resurrection. I hope you enjoy both of them.</p>

[Verse]
Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me!
I once was lost, but now am found,
Was blind, but now I see!

[Verse 2]
'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear,
And grace, my fears relieved!
How precious did that grace appear,
The hour I first believed!

[Chorus]
Pie Jesu domine
Dona eis requiem
Pie Jesu domine
Dona eis requiem

[Verse 4]
Through many dangers, toils and snares
I have already come!
'Tis grace that's brought me safe thus far
And grace will lead me home!

[Verse 3]
The LORD has promised good to me,
His word, my hope secures!
He will my shield and portion be,
As long as life endures!

[Verse 5]
When we've been there ten thousand years
Bright shining as the sun!
We'll've no less days to sing God's praise
Than when we'd first begun!

[Chorus]
Pie Jesu domine
Dona eis requiem
Pie Jesu domine
Dona eis requiem
