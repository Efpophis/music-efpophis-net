notes: |
  <p>This song is a response to the October 7th attacks against Israel. and the absolutely disgusting rise in anti-semitism that has followed Israel's response. It is meant to reflect the grief of God's people as they deal with the aftermath of the attacks, and their longing for the elusive dream of real, lasting peace.</p>

  <p>The Chorus, in Hebrew and English, is taken from Lamentations 5:21.</p>

[Verse 1]
Help us, oh God, we pray, for we are hopelessly surrounded!
our enemies have crept in unawares.
They spill our blood in the streets,
take our sons and daughters captive,
and profane your sanctuary.
On our holiest day, they have done this to us!

[Verse 2]
Hear us in our grief, and answer our prayers, oh God
Have mercy on us, and return the captives home
You, and You alone are God, and we are Your people
You number our tears, and will vindicate us in time

[Chorus]
Hashivenu, Adonai, elecha venashuva
chadesh yamenu kekedem
Turn us, Oh LORD, and we shall return
Renew our lives as in days of old

[Verse 3]
They horrify us with savagery, oh Lord, how long?
How long, will they invoke our destruction?
How long, oh Lord, will peace be a dream?
How long, oh Lord, until you turn tribulation to triumph?

[Verse 4]
Until we turn from our ways, and repent of our deeds
Until we remember Messiah has come, and He will come again
Until we turn back to You, oh God, and worship in truth
Then, in the fullness of time, the end of this darkness will come

[Chorus]
Hashivenu, Adonai, elecha venashuva
chadesh yamenu kekedem
Turn us, Oh LORD, and we shall return
Renew our lives as in days of old

[Chorus]
Hashivenu, Adonai, elecha venashuva
chadesh yamenu kekedem
Turn us, Oh LORD, and we shall return
Renew our lives as in days of old
