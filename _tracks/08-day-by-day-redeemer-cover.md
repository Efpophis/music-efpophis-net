  <p>Day By Day was a fun little song we used to sing back in the Redeemer days. It never made it onto a recording, never got written down, and was played live maybe 3 or 4 times. I had wanted to include it on my first Redeemer Project album, but not a single one of us could remember enough of the lyrics.</p>

  <p>Then, one day, miraculously it seems, more of the lyrics popped into my head, along with an idea for an arrangement. Thus, I was finally able to bring this old song back to life - maybe not in time to make it into The Redeemer Project's catalog, but at least it got done eventually.</p>

[Verse]
So many choices
In a world of hate
Better make your decision
Before it's too late

[verse 2]
'Cause when it all comes down
It's about who you choose
And if you die without Jesus
Man, you're gonna lose

[bridge]
But in Christ there is peace
In His grace, there is hope
In faith, find His love
And call on His name

[chorus]
All I have wanted, I found in you
And now I must walk in the way
All I could need, I found it in your name
And I call on it day by day

[interlude]
[instrumental]

[verse 3]
Now the end is coming
And it's time to go
Will you follow Him?
Or try to make it on your own?

[verse 4]
To cross the ocean
And find rest for your soul
It's too far to swim
And He's got the only boat

[bridge]
And in Christ there is peace
In His grace, there is hope
In faith, find His love
And call on His name

[chorus]
All I have wanted, I found in you
And now I must walk in the way
All I could need, I found it in your name
And I call on it day by day

[Interlude]
[Instrumental: guitar solo]

[Outro]
All I have wanted, I found in you
And now I must walk in the way
All I could need, I found it in your name
And I call on it day by day
I call on it day by day ...

[end]
