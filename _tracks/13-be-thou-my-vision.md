  <p>Traditional Irish hymn. Lyrics are in the public domain.</p>

  <p>This is one of my favorite traditional hymns. I wanted to show it some love by redoing it "me style." I think this version came out pretty solid.</p>

[Verse]
Be thou my vision, O Lord of my heart;
naught be all else to me, save that thou art
thou my best thought, by day or by night;
waking or sleeping, thy presence my light.

[Verse]
Be thou my wisdom, and thou my true word;
I ever with thee and thou with me, Lord.
Thou my great Father; thine own may I be,
thou in me dwelling and I one with thee.

[Verse]
Riches I heed not, nor vain, empty praise;
thou mine inheritance, now and always:
thou and thou only first in my heart,
high King of heaven, my treasure thou art.

[Verse]
High King of heaven, my victory won,
may I reach heaven’s joys, O bright heaven’s sun!
Heart of my own heart, whatever befall,
still be my vision, O Ruler of all.

[Verse]
Riches I heed not, nor vain, empty praise;
thou mine inheritance, now and always:
thou and thou only first in my heart,
high King of heaven, my treasure thou art.

[Verse]
High King of heaven, my victory won,
may I reach heaven’s joys, O bright heaven’s sun!
Heart of my own heart, whatever befall,
still be my vision, O Ruler of all.
