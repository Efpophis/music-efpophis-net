[Intro]
[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Can a singer sing a song
That's genuinely bad
If it was written that way all along?
Well here's an idea: let's find out!

[Spoken] here it goes .. 

[Instrumental]

[Chorus] 
This song is supposed to suck
Why you even listenin' to this lousy tune?
I guess it's just your rotten luck
'Cuz this song is supposed to suck, 
And it does. 

[Instrumental]

[Verse 2]
Well, the style is cheesy and the rhymes are all forced 
It's like trying to put roller skates on a horse
What the heck does that mean? I don't even know
Just pray it doesn't get much worse, cuz..

[Chorus] 
This song is supposed to suck
Why you even listenin' to this lousy tune?
I guess it's just your rotten luck
'Cuz this song is supposed to suck, 
And it does.

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
Well, people don't think it be like that,
But baby, surely it do (baby, it do)
I tried writin' me a rock and roll tune,
But I just ended up singin' the blues!

[Spoken] you know that's right! 

[Chorus] 
This song is supposed to suck
Why you even listenin' to this lousy tune?
I guess it's just your rotten luck
'Cuz this song is supposed to suck, and it does

[Outro]
This song is supposed to suck
Why you even listenin' to this lousy tune?
I guess it's just your rotten, rotten luck! 
'Cuz this song is supposed to suck
This song is supposed to suck
And it surely, surely does.

[Ending]
Well, that sucked!
