```text
[Verse 1]
Roar, Lion of Judah, House of Jacob
Stand strong, sons of Israel, Chosen of God
For God will scatter your enemies, Scatter them far and wide
Crush their weapons, and shield you from their spite

[Chorus]
Rise up, Lion of Judah, Children of Jacob
Rise up, Sons of Israel, Sons of God
For God is with you, He has blessed you
Who, then, shall you fear? Of whom shall you be afraid?

[Verse 2]
Unleash His power, Ru'ach ha'Kodesh arise!
Though this is the time of Jacob's trouble,
Today is the day of The LORD's salvation!
ba-ruch Ha-ba b'ashem Adonai, Yeshua ha Moshiach!

[Verse 3]
Messiah has come and will come again
And so all Israel will be saved
Rejoice, daughters of Zion, and grieve no more,
For the day of the LORD has come!

[Chorus]
Rise up, Lion of Judah, House of Jacob
Rise up, Sons of Israel, Sons of God
For God is with you, He has blessed you
Who, then, shall you fear? Of whom shall you be afraid?
