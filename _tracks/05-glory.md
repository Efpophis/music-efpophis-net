notes: |
  <p>Inspired by the "Gloria" from the Latin liturgy, translated to English, finessed a little, and black-metaled thoroughly. There's not enough really heavy metal Christian worship music, so I'm doing my part to change that.</p>

  <p>With that in mind, I had a really hard time with this song. It went through several iterations before I got a version I really like, and that I felt was extreme enough. To accomplish that, I had to go all the way back to the title track from Yahweh Our Light - I re-used some of the prompts from that, and refined them a little more to come up with this loud, obnoxious, face-melting, ear-splitting, extreme worship song. Not everyone will like it - some will probably loathe it. But it is offered to God with a sincere and worshipful heart, and that's what's most important.</p>

  <p>Verse 3 pleads "LORD hear our prayer" - you play this loud enough, and I don't think that'll be a problem.</p>
