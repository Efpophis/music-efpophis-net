[Intro]
[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
In the beginning was the Word
And the Word was with God
And the Word was God
And the Word was God
And the Word was God

[Verse 2]
And all that came to be had life in Him
That life was the light of men,
The light that shines in the darkness
And the darkness will never prevail
YEAH!!

[Bridge]
The only Son of the Father Almighty
The Son of Yahweh has come

[Chorus]
And the Word became flesh
And dwelt among us
The Word became flesh
And we saw His glory
Full of Grace and Truth

[Interlude]
[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
He is the true light
Who enlightens us all
He came into the world
But the world could not believe

[Verse 4]
But to those who believed Him
To those who received Him
He gave the power to become
The children of God
The children of God
The children of God

[Bridge]
Behold, the lamb of God
Who takes away the sins of the world

[Chorus]
And the Word became flesh
And dwelt among us
The Word became flesh
And we saw His glory
Full of Grace and Truth

[Interlude]
[Instrumental]

[Outro]
And the Word became flesh
And dwelt among us
The Word became flesh
And we saw His glory
Full of Grace and Truth

[Ending]
