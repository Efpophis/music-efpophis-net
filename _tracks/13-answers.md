  <p>It's okay to ask questions. Especially if you know Who the answer is.</p>

  <p>This track is sung entirely from Jesus' point of view. It's based on his "I am" statements, mostly from the gospel according to John.</p>

[Intro]
[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
I am the bread of life
Whoever comes to me shall not hunger
Whoever believes in me shall never thirst again

[verse 2]
I am the light of the world
Whoever follows me will not walk in darkness
But will have the light of life

[Chorus]
I am the resurrection and the life
Whoever believes in me
Though he die
Yet shall he live again

[Interlude]
[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
I am the door
If anyone enters by me
He will be saved and will go in and out
And find pasture

[Verse 4]
I am the good shepherd
I know my own, and they know me
The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep

[Chorus]
I am the resurrection and the life
Whoever believes in me
Though he die
Yet shall he live again

[Interlude]
[Instrumental]

[Verse 5]
I am the vine
You are the branches
Whoever abides in me and I in him
He it is that bears much fruit
For apart from me, you can do nothing.

[Chorus]
I am the resurrection and the life
Whoever believes in me
Though he die
Yet shall he live again


[Outro]
I am the way (I am the answer)
I am the truth (I am the answer)
I am the life (I am the answer)
No one comes to God except through me (I am the answer)

I AM WHO I AM

I AM

JESUS CHRIST!!!

[Ending]
