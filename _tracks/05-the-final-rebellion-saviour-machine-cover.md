[Intro]
[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Satan
come forth, Come forth
for my grace is empty
And all vengeance is mine

[Verse 2]
Satan
come forth, Come forth 
to the everlasting fire
Prepared for your time

[Spoken] YEEE-HAW! Giddy-up, Satan! C'mon, let's go!

[Interlude]
[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
Come
Satan
you and your angels
Come
face your hell and damnation

[Chorus]
Come
Satan
you and your angels
Come
face your hell and damnation

[Chorus]
Come
Satan
you and your angels
Come
face your hell and damnation

[Break]

[Bridge]
I never knew your name
Unto the burning flame

[Interlude]
[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
Lost is thy name
To the flame
The Liar
Be silent
Be gone
Deceive
No more
Deceive no more

[Short interlude]
[Instrumental]

[Outro]
Lost is thy name
To the flame
The Liar
Be silent
Be gone
Deceive
No more
Deceive no more

[Ending]
