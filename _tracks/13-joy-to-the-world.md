notes: "It was really hard to get a good version of this song. I think that was because of the unique-ish structure. There's no real chorus or bridge, it's just the melody repeated with different words for each verse. The AI had issues with that until I finally clicked it into submission."

[Verse 1]
Joy to the world, the LORD is come!
Let Earth receive her King!
Let every heart prepare Him room,
And Heaven and nature sing,
And Heaven and nature sing,
And Heaven, and Heaven and nature sing.


[Verse 2]
Joy to the Earth, the Saviour reigns!
Let men their songs employ,
While fields and floods, rocks, hills, and plains
Repeat the sounding joy,
Repeat the sounding joy,
Repeat, repeat the sounding joy.

[Verse 3]
No more let sins and sorrows grow,
Nor thorns infest the ground;
He comes to make His blessings flow
Far as the curse is found,
Far as the curse is found,
Far as, far as the curse is found.

[Verse 4]
He rules the world with truth and grace,
And makes the nations prove
The glories of His righteousness
And wonders of His love,
And wonders of His love,
And wonders, wonders of His love.

[Outro]
Let every heart prepare Him room
And Heaven and nature sing
And Heaven and nature sing
And Heaven, and Heaven and nature sing.
