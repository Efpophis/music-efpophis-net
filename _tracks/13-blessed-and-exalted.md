  <p>There really needs to be more metal worship music, so I'm doing my part.</p>

  <p>I wanted a metal worship song, so I just kinda came up with some lyrics and rolled with it. I also wanted to experiment more with audio prompting the AI, so this time I recorded myself playing the intro bass line and used that to start with. The first few seconds are 100% me on bass before the AI takes over. I also apparently can't write a song anymore without throwing in some Hebrew, so we have that.</p>

[Intro]
[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Be exalted, oh Yahweh almighty
Be exalted above the Heavens
Be exalted, oh Yahweh our God
Let your glory fill the earth
Let your glory fill the heavens

[Verse 2]
Blessed are you, oh Yeshua our savior
Who gives us life and saves us from death
Blessed are you, oh Christ our LORD
Who died in our place, and lives again

[Bridge]
[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
Blessed be the name (בָּרוּך השם)
Of the LORD our God (אדוני אלוהינו)
Blessed be the name (בָּרוּך השם)
Of the LORD our God (אדוני אלוהינו)
Blessed be His holy name

[Verse 3]
Blessed are you, oh Holy Spirit
Blessed are you, רוח הקודש
Who fills us with your presence
And turns our hearts to you

[Verse 4]
Even when we wandered far away
You came to our aid, in time
With grace amazing and forgiveness divine
Blessed are you, oh God our Savior
Holy is your name

[Bridge]

[Outro]
Blessed be the name (בָּרוּך השם)
Of the LORD our God (אדוני אלוהינו)
Blessed be the name (בָּרוּך השם)
Of the LORD our God (אדוני אלוהינו)
Blessed be His holy name

[Ending]

<div class="lyrics">
  Hebrew Translation:
  
  "Baruch Hashem Adonai Elohenu" translates to "Blessed be the Name of the LORD, our God."
  
  "Ruach HaKodesh" is the Hebrew rendering of "Holy Spirit"
  
  "Yeshua" of course, is Jesus' Hebrew name.
