[Intro]
[Interlude]
[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
So what the heck were you thinking
It's gotta come out there's no reason to pout
I can't believe you're embarrassed
Pooping is fun, just flush when you're done

[Verse 2]
It's a well-known fact
A simply natural act
It must pass through your tract
On the daily

[Chorus]
Everybody poops (poops)
Everybody poops (poops)
Everybody poops (poops)
Eventually

[Interlude]

[Verse 3]
It might be stuck - constipation
Fiber's the trick to makin' it slick
Or possibly diarrhea
It's all leaky and wet you're stuck on the toilet

[Verse 4]
You're waiting in  the queue
Your face is turning blue
You must go number 2
In a hurry

[Chorus]

[Interlude]

[Bridge]
[Spoken] break it down!
Girls poop and boys poop and dogs poop and cats poop too
You know it's true
Big turds and wet turds and small turds and round turds too
Float in the loo

[Verse 5]
Moms poop and dads poop and whales poop and you poop too
You know you do (it's true!)
It's sloppy and icky and stinky and drippy too
It's not taboo

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Everybody poops (poops)
Everybody poops (poops)
Everybody poops (poops)
Eventually

[Ending]
[Spoken] Everybody poops!
```
