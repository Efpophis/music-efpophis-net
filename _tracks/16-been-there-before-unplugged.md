  <p>This was a very early Redeemer tune composed by our drummer, Scott Mattson. It was originally an acoustic ballad and one of our only songs where I sang backing vocals since there was no keyboard part for me to worry about. It was a real pain to recover the lyrics as none of us could remember them. Finally, Mark Fisher managed to find an old demo cassette tape and an even older cassette player and was able to recover the lyrics.</p>

  <p>I released a "glam metal ballad" version on <a href="/albums/death-and-resurrection">Death and Resurrection</a>, my first album. But I still missed the folksy, acoustic, and intimate feel of the original the way we used to play it. So I had the AI do a "cover" in that style, and it gave me what sounds like a "live" version of the song. It's eerily similar to the version we used to play, and so it's now my favorite version of this song.</p>

[Verse 1]
I know you feel alone
I know you feel as if no one understands
I wanted to let you know
There's a true love out there
Just believe me and take Jesus' hand

[Chorus] 
And I know all the tears you cried
And I know all the fears you hide
It hurts, I know; I've been there before
I've been there before
I've been there before

[Verse 2]
I want you to know the one 
Who came and died to set you free
Who loves you, can't you see?

[Chorus] 
And I know all the tears you cried
And I know all the fears you hide
It hurts, I know; I've been there before
I've been there before
I've been there before

[Bridge]
(Instrumental)

[Verse 3]
No more pain and no more fear
Everlasting peace year after year
Open up and let Jesus in
You'll be free forever from the burden of sin

[Chorus] 
And I know all the tears you cried
And I know all the fears you hide
It hurts, I know; I've been there before
I've been there before
I've been there before

[Chorus]
He knows all the tears you cried
He knows all the fears you hide
It hurts, Jesus knows, He's been there before
He's been there before
He's been there before
He's been there before
