notes: "The AI got a major upgrade recently, and since then, I have been able to experiment more with much more detailed prompts. I can now do things like specify instruments and tonal scales, etc.. So I ran with it and asked it to make me some metal using traditional Middle Eastern instruments, scales, and rhythms. This is my first result. It's ridiculously long, probably boring, etc. But it has this great dark desert feel to it that really gets under your skin, while also conjuring images of early to mid-1970s prog rock and early heavy metal. Give it a chance. It'll grow on you."

[Verse]
In the valley of vision, where silence groans
I beheld a sea of dry and scattered bones
The wind was howling as it scattered the sand
Life be not found in the desolate land

[Verse 2]
A voice said, "Son, can these bones rise?"
As I stared into their hollow eyes,
He said, "Prophesy! Speak! Let my words ignite"
"A spark of hope in the endless night.."

[Chorus]
Bones to flesh, now rise up again
A mighty army from this barren land
The breath of life and an empty tomb
In the valley of decision, God's spirit moves

[Interlude]
[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
The rattle echoed through the burning air
Bone joined to bone, so began the repair
Tendons formed, and new skin was laid
The lifeless eyes became a blaze

[Bridge]
Oh, hear the thunder of the new heartbeat
As those once dead rise to their feet
From dust to life, His power is shown
And the voice of Yahweh claims His own

[Chorus]
Bones to flesh, now rise up again
A mighty army from this barren land
The breath of life and an empty tomb
In the valley of decision, God's spirit moves

[Interlude]
[Instrumental]

[Verse 4]
Rise up, dry bones, hear the Savior's call
From the depths of silence, it's time to stand tall
The Word of the LORD whispers through the night
Come alive, oh bones, and stand in his light

[Verse 5]
Breath from the heavens brings life to the dead
Their hearts begin beating, they lift up their heads 
Once they were scattered, now they stand as one
An army of life raised by His Son

[Bridge]
Oh, hear the thunder of the new heartbeat
As those once dead rise to their feet
From dust to life, His power is shown
And the voice of Yahweh claims His own

[Chorus]
Bones to flesh, now rise up again
A mighty army from this barren plain
The breath of life and an empty tomb
In the valley of decision, God's spirit moves

[Interlude]
[Instrumental]

[Outro]
Oh, hear the thunder of the new heartbeat
As those once dead rise to their feet
From dust to life, His power is shown
And the voice of Yahweh claims His own

[Chorus]
Bones to flesh, now rise up again
A mighty army from this barren plain
The breath of life and an empty tomb
In the valley of decision, God's spirit moves

[Interlude]
[Instrumental]

[End]
