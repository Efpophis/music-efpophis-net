  <p>Sorry, Saviour Machine - I stole your title +:)</p>

  <p>I wanted a song that was part telling the gospel and part testimony, and I think this one checks both of those boxes. Jesus' own life demonstrates his faithfulness, as does his influence on those who follow him. I've been following him since I was 14 years old, and I've had my ups and downs and made some colossal mistakes, etc. But, Jesus has always been faithful, always by my side, even when I was unfaithful and walked away from him. His power and desire to save the soul and guide the seeker is unparalleled and uncanny.</p>

[Verse]
In a world full of darkness and doubt
I found the everlasting light
The fire burning deep inside
A story of new life, yet old as time
Of the One who lived a perfect life

[Verse]
They called him prophet
healer, savior, the King of kings, the Son of Man
He is all of this and more:
A renegade of love in a world of hate
He turned the water into wine
He fed the hungry crowds
Healed the sick and raised the dead
But they nailed him to a cross
He gave his life
to make us whole

[Chorus]
Oh
Jesus Christ (Jesus Christ)
Your faithfulness will never fail
You're the rock that I lean on
My guiding light
Through the storm and the chaos
You'll never lead  astray
Jesus Christ (Jesus Christ)
Your faithfulness lights the way

[Verse]
They laid Him in a tomb
Sealed it all up tight
But even in the darkest grave
He could not be contained
He rose again
Conquering death and hell
He Left an empty grave
and a love that forever remains

[Verse]
I've seen the miracles
I've felt the healing touch
In the darkness of the night
I've heard his voice calling
Through every trial
Every struggle I face
His faithfulness keeps me from falling

[Chorus]
Oh
Jesus Christ (Jesus Christ)
Your faithfulness will never fail
You're the rock that I lean on
My guiding light
Through the storm and the chaos
You'll never lead astray
Jesus Christ (Jesus Christ)
Your faithfulness lights the way

[Chorus]
Oh
Jesus Christ (Jesus Christ)
Your faithfulness will never fail
You're the rock that I lean on
My guiding light
Through the storm and the chaos
You'll never lead astray
Jesus Christ (Jesus Christ)
Your faithfulness lights the way
