notes: |
  <p>I'm a little bummed that my last Klingon song won't be death metal, but I can live with it.</p>
  <p>This one was inspired by a meme showing 3 Klingons wearing sunglasses and captioned "Depeche Mogh."</p>
  <p>I laughed and said, "Yeah, they'd have a song called 'Personal Kahless' and it'd be all about going into battle and stuff."</p>
  <p>So, of course, I had to do it. Now, the AI doesn't let me specify artists or songs in any of the prompts, so I can't tell it "give me a parody of Depeche Mode's 'Personal Jesus' with lyrics in Klingon."</p>
  <p>I had to come up with the Klingon on my own, with the help of a translator app. I tried to get the syllables and cadence as close as I could to 'Personal Jesus' while maintaining a parallel theme relating to Kahless in the meaning of the Klingon words. It took some effort to get it just right. After that, I had to convince the AI to give me a synth-poppy rendition that resembled DM in style. I figured the closest I would get is a style parody, not a direct parody of the song, and that's what I got.</p>
