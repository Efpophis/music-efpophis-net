[Verse 1]
I go to my job by day
I go to my wife at night
I put my kids to bed
Tell them how Jesus lead

[Verse 2]
I worked so hard today
all I want is an honest pay
I feel like giving in
'cause my life is consumed by my sin

[Chorus]
If I only knew then what I wish I knew now
maybe I could get free of this life somehow
I feel like a tired old circus freak
I wanna belong to something true
set me free

[Verse 3]
I feel the touch by the love of God
first it felt like peace, then it was gone
I have to bandage my need
Open wounds just heal then bleed again

[Verse 4]
Call this enduring the race
Keeping up with the pace
I feel like falling down
Then Your grace surrounds

[Bridge]
Blood runs down from the holes in His hands
washing away the ordeal of a lifetime of pain
Is this feeling real?
You show Your light
You're in my life
I am not on my own
separate new from old
I feel Your blood in my veins
As You rise above my shame

[Chorus]
If I only knew then what I wish I knew now
maybe I could get free of this life somehow
I feel like a tired old circus freak
I wanna belong to something true
set me free

[Outro]
set me free, set me free, set me free
set me free
