[Verse]
Lullaby, Jesus, O cease from your crying,
Here on Your Mother's warm breast softly lying.

[Chorus]
Lullaby, Jesus, O sleep now, my treasure
Mother is Watching with love none can measure.
Lullaby, Jesus, O sleep now, my treasure
Mother is Watching with love none can measure.

[Verse]
See how the world lies in sorrow and sadness;
Give us Your blessing, O bring Heaven's gladness!

[Chorus]
Lullaby, Jesus, O sleep now, my treasure
Mother is Watching with love none can measure.
Lullaby, Jesus, O sleep now, my treasure
Mother is Watching with love none can measure.

[Verse]
See how the world lies in sorrow and sadness;
Give us Your blessing, O bring Heaven's gladness!

[Chorus]
Lullaby, Jesus, O sleep now, my treasure
Mother is Watching with love none can measure.
Lullaby, Jesus, O sleep now, my treasure
Mother is Watching with love none can measure.

[Outro]
Lullaby, Jesus, O sleep now, my treasure
Mother is Watching with love none can measure.
Lullaby, Jesus, O sleep now, my treasure
Mother is Watching with love none can measure.
