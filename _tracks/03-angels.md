[Verse 1]
Angels we have heard on high,
Sweetly singing o'er the plains,
And the mountains in reply
Echoing their joyous strains

[Chorus]
Gloria, in excelsis Deo!
Gloria, in excelsis Deo!

[Verse 2]
Shepherds, why this jubilee?
Why your joyous strains prolong?
What the gladsome tidings be
Which inspire your heav'nly song?

[Chorus]

[Break]
[Interlude]
[Instrumental: guitar]

[Verse 3]
Come to Bethlehem and see
Him whose birth the angels sing;
Come, adore on bended knee
Christ the LORD, the new-born King. 


[Verse 4]
See Him in a manger laid,
Jesus, Lord of heaven and earth!
Mary, Joseph, lend your aid,
Sing with us our Saviour's birth. 

[Chorus]

[Outro: majestic, dramatic]
Gloria, oh Gloria, in excelsis Deo
Hosanna in excelsis
Gloria in excelsis Deo

  Translations:
  
  Gloria in excelsis Deo - Glory to God in the highest.
  
  Hosanna in excelsis - Praise to God* in the highest.
  
*this is a loose translation. Hosanna literally means "Save us" which doesn't fit well into an English translation of the phrase.
