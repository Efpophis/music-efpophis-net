[Intro]
[Instrumental]

[Spoken] Lemme tell y'all 'bout my doggy ...

[Verse 1]
Well, she's a little snuggly cuddle-bug
She's a derpy, dopy snuggle dog
She got one blue eye,
And the other one's brown!

[Bridge]
She's my trash-munchin, paper poopin'
Stanky-breath, food-steelin' baby!

[Chorus]
She's Nacho Typical Dog!
Nacho Typical Dog!
She's got one blue eye, and a waggy little tail,
She's Nacho Typical Dog!

[Spoken] You know that's right!

[Instrumental]

[Spoken] Now, listen up!

[Verse 2]
Well, she's got a bright purple collar, and brown swirly hair (that gets all over everything, by the way) 
She'll jump up on the table and steel your chicken nuggets
Before you even know she's there!

[Bridge]
She's my  paper poopin', trash munchin',
Stanky-breath, food-steelin' baby!

[Chorus]
She's Nacho Typical Dog!
Nacho Typical Dog!
She's got one blue eye, and a waggy little tail,
She's Nacho Typical Dog!

[Spoken] Now that's what I'm talkin' about!

[Interlude]
[Instrumental]
[Break]

[Spoken] Here comes the best part now, y'all ...

[Verse 3]
Well, she loves to go for walks
Or a ride in the car!
She's a sucker for a treat
She's the best little doggy you'll ever, ever meet!

[Bridge]
She's my trash-munchin, paper poopin'
Stanky-breath, food-steelin' baby!

[Chorus]
She's Nacho Typical Dog!
Nacho Typical Dog!
She's got one blue eye, and a waggy little tail,
She's Nacho Typical Dog!

[Instrumental]

[Outro]
She's Nacho Typical Dog!
Nacho Typical Dog!
She's got one blue eye, and a waggy little tail,
She's Nacho Typical Dog!

[Ending]
And she's such a good ...
Good! ... 
Oh, she's such a very good girl, oh yeah!
She's NACHO TYPICAL DOG!
