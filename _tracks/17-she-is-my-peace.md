notes: |
  <p>Every so often, I wake up from a nightmare - usually about something horrible happening, or losing everything that's ever mattered to me. Sometimes they're sad. Sometimes they're frightening. Sometimes I wake up feeling completely lost and alone.</p>

  <p>And then I look next to me, and she's there. And I know it was just a dream and everything is ok.</p>

  <p>I didn't always have her. In fact, it took entirely too long for us to find each other. I can't even begin to express the peace and comfort she brings to my heart on a daily basis. This track is a pale attempt, at best, to do so.</p>

  <p>And yeah, it's also a shout-out to Alice Cooper. Deal with it.</p>

[Intro – spoken]
"Once I walked alone in a land filled with shadows…
The full moon was my witness… the dead, my only grim companions.
But then she found me … and all the monsters fled."


[Verse 1]
I’ve walked through the fire, I've felt the devil’s breath
I've heard the voice of frigid shadows, whispering of death
In the castle of my nightmares, I was the king of the lonely damned
Then her light broke through my darkness as she held my withered hand

[Pre-Chorus]
She banished the specters that called to me by name,
She turned my coffin to a cradle, and my curse into a flame

[Chorus]
When the darkness surrounds me (she is my peace)
When the nightmares come calling (she is my peace)
When my house of cards comes crashing down
When all my hope is gone, she holds me in her arms (and everything’s all right)
She is my love, my only one, she is my peace (she is my peace)

[Interlude]
[Instrumental]

[Verse 2]
I’ve seen many kingdoms crumble, I’ve heard the angels cry
I've borne the weight of the world and the silence of the sky
Through the graveyard of my mind, she will never leave my side
She'll always be the treasure I never thought I'd find

[Bridge]
I was nothing but a ghost in a carnival of souls
Trapped in the endless maze of a house, but not a home
But she lit every dusty hallway, she unlocked each frozen door
Now the nightmare’s just a memory — and I fear it nevermore

[Chorus]
When the darkness surrounds me (she is my peace)
When the nightmares come calling (she is my peace)
When my house of cards comes crashing down
When all my hope is gone, she holds me in her arms (and everything’s all right)
She is my love, my only one, she is my peace (she is my peace)

[Interlude]
[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
She walks through the graveyard, unhindered by the cold
With eyes that see beauty where the world sees ancient bones
The ravens cease their cries when her shadow draws near
And the demons in my mind flee from her in fear

[Bridge]
In the crypt of my tears, she is the open door
Through the rattling of my chains, she is the lion’s roar
And when my soul is burning, when my blood runs cold
She brings the peace of God where no one else would go

[Instrumental]

She is my peace
She is my peace


[Chorus]
When the darkness surrounds me (she is my peace)
When the nightmares come calling (she is my peace)
When my house of cards comes crashing down
When all my hope is gone, she holds me in her arms (and everything’s all right)
She is my love, my only one, she is my peace (she is my peace)

[Interlude]
[Instrumental]

[Outro - spoken]
The darkness still waits for me … and it always will.
But as long as she walks beside me…
It waits in vain.

[End]
