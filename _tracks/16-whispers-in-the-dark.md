notes: |
  <p>Everyone, if they've lived and loved enough, has a story like this. Maybe it was a first love, maybe it was a friendship where you wanted more and the other person didn't, or maybe both of you were too scared to make a move, and for whatever reason, it never happened.</p>

  <p>Personally, I have always been one to fall quickly and hard .. and then never quite fully recover. Sure, life goes on, and we move on, and eventually we find the one we're meant to be with. I have, and I wouldn't change a single thing. But I still have a few of these in my past.</p>

  <p>Even so, sometimes those old memories and dreams come back. Sometimes it's impossible not to remember an old flame with fondness and that familiar aching tinge of nostalgia, wondering what could have been if things had been different. You realize that, even tho you've moved on and are happy with your life, there's still a part of you that will always love them in some way.</p>

  <p>This is a song to explore those feelings.</p>
  <p>This song is for "the one(s) that got away."</p>

[Intro]
Sometimes I wonder if you still remember me
'Cause there’s a place in my heart where you'll always be

[Verse 1]
I still remember that warm summer rain
We talked until dawn and forgot all the pain
Your laughter and smile like a burnin' flame
Lit a fire inside me that I can’t explain

[Verse 2]
But the years rolled on and we went separate ways
With new vows to keep, till the end of our days
But sometimes I feel that old flame in the dark
A quiet ache burning inside my faithful heart

[Bridge]
But this lifetime is promised to somebody else
And my heart now belongs to another
But I still can’t forget you, tho God knows I've tried
And I’ll always love you somehow (love you somehow)

[Chorus]
So softly, I whisper your name in the dark
Never to hold you in my aching arms
And always to wonder and dream
Of what might have been (I wonder and dream)
Of what might have been

[Interlude]
[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
No, I've got no regrets for this life I chose
But some doors that we shut never fully close
In the still of the night, you haunt me again
A bittersweet end to what never began

[Chorus]
So softly, I whisper your name in the dark
Never to hold you in my aching arms
And always to wonder and dream
Of what might have been (I wonder and dream)
Of what might have been

[Instrumental - guitar solo]

[Outro]
Somewhere in the dark, I still whisper your name
With a teardrop hidden by the pouring rain
I hope you find everything your heart desires
'Cause you'll always be a part of me (a part of me)

[Bridge]
But this lifetime is promised to somebody else
And my heart now belongs to another
But I still can’t forget you, tho God knows I've tried
And I’ll always love you somehow (love you somehow)

[Chorus]
So softly, I whisper your name in the dark
Never to hold you in my aching arms
And always to wonder and dream
Of what might have been (I wonder and dream)
Of what might have been

[Ending]
