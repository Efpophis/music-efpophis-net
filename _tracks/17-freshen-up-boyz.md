[Intro]
[Instrumental]

[Spoken] Ewww!  What's that smell??

[Verse 1]
Sweat clouds follow you like a ghost
It's not the cologne that you boast
No roses no spice just… what is that?
Time to face the truth stat

[Verse 2]
You walk in the room it’s a chemical fight
The air turns heavy not a breeze in sight
Boys don’t you smell it the world holds its nose
Time to clean up from your head to your toes

[Bridge]
Soap’s not your enemy it’s your best friend
This funk parade has got to end

[Prechorus]
Oh boys
Oh boys
Can't ignore the smell
Step in the shower
Ring that bell

[Chorus]
Freshen up
Boys
It's time to glow
Scrub-a-dub-dub
Let the freshness flow
No excuses
Grab that soap
Deodorant’s your new hope
Freshen up boys hit the shower right now
No more excuses don’t ask me how
Lather up rinse off grab that spray
The funk is done it’s a brand-new day

[Interlude]

[Verse 3]
You think it's cool
You think it’s fine
But the air's turning into a crime
We’re gasping
Wheezing
Holding our breath
This funk’s a ticket to social death

[Verse 4]
Sweat’s not a trophy it’s not a badge
It’s a stinky cloud like old gym bags
Deodorant’s magic it works like a charm
Rub it on now it won’t do you harm

[Bridge]
Don’t blame the weather don’t blame the heat
It’s you my guys smelling like defeat

oh-oh-oh

[Prechorus]
Oh boys
Oh boys
Hear the call
Lather rinse repeat
Fix it all

[Chorus]
Freshen up
Boys
It's time to glow
Scrub-a-dub-dub
Let the freshness flow
No excuses
Grab that soap
Deodorant’s your new hope
Freshen up boys hit the shower right now
No more excuses don’t ask me how
Lather up rinse off grab that spray
The funk is done it’s a brand-new day

[Interlude]
[Instrumental]
[Bass drop]

[Outro]
Freshen up
Boys
It's time to glow
Scrub-a-dub-dub
Let the freshness flow
No excuses
Grab that soap
Deodorant’s your new hope
Freshen up boys hit the shower right now
No more excuses don’t ask me how
Lather up rinse off grab that spray
The funk is done it’s a brand-new day

[Ending]
