  <p>This track came about quite by accident. When trying to create the heavy version, I accidentally pasted the title into the style prompt and the style into the title. So I got a track titled "Old School Punk Thrash Metal" in the style of "a snack and a nap." So apparently, this is what the AI thinks a genre called "a snack and a nap" would sound like.</p>

  <p>Once I figured out what happened, I was able to create the main version as I wanted. But this cut was so hilarious and good in its own right, I just had to use it on the album somewhere as well. I feel like this is a version the Veggie Tales would perform ...</p>

```text
[Verse 1]
The prophet, afraid for his life
He flees to the desert and hides under a bush
Starving and thirsty, he's had enough
He cried, "Oh God, just let me die!"

[Verse 2]
An angel appeared while the prophet slept.
"Get up," he said, "have something to eat,
"I've got fresh-baked bread
And some delicious iced tea!"

[Chorus]
Sometimes when you think it can't get much worse
When you're out of your mind and dying of thirst
When the world wants you dead, 
And you think you'll oblige

[Spoken]
[A Capella]
Never underestimate the power .. of a snack and a nap.

[Ending]
