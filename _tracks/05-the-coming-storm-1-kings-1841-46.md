notes: "After the victory on Mt Carmel, the king of Israel and the people repent and, at least momentarily, return to worshipping Yahweh alone. For the last 3 years, famine had devastated the land - the consequence of their apostasy and Ba'al worship. Now, Elijah spots a small cloud in the west - it's about to rain..."

[Verse 1]
I know it's been a long time
Since you've seen a drop of rain
Since you've heard the sound of thunder
Since you've felt the cool breeze on your face

[Verse 2]
I know it feels like forever
Since you've heard the voice of God
You've been lookin' for a way to ease the pain
And now, at last, the time has come

[Bridge]
There's a small cloud in the west
And the wind begins to howl
That rumble in the distance tells you
This trial is almost done

[Chorus]
'Cause there's a powerful rain that's coming
For His kingdom is on the rise
Just Look to the horizon, and you will see...
The coming storm, the coming storm

[Verse 3]
This drought and desolation
Has gone on long enough
The land that forgot it's God
Must remember, Oh, we must remember

[Verse 4]
That Yahweh is our God
Who brings salvation by His grace
There is no one like our God
There is no one else

[Bridge 2]
So let the rain come down
And let it heal this barren ground
Let the living rivers rise
And let His light shine in our eyes once again.

[Chorus]
'Cause there's a powerful rain that's coming
For His kingdom is on the rise
Just look to the horizon, and you will see...
The coming storm, the coming storm

Behold the storm

[Bridge]
There's a small cloud in the west
And the wind begins to howl
That rumble in the distance tells you
This trial is almost done

[Outro]
'Cause there's a powerful rain that's coming
For His kingdom is on the rise
Just Look to the horizon, and you will see...
The coming storm, the coming storm

Behold, the coming of the storm ...
