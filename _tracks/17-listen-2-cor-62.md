notes: "Since this is my last album, I wanted to make sure I had a song that sums up the whole point of this project: to worship God and proclaim His message of salvation by grace received by faith. Rest assured, there will come a time in everyone's life when there's no time left. Everyone, somehow or another, must decide to follow Jesus Christ or not. We don't have any way of knowing when it will be too late, so it's not wise to put it off - not for another minute."

[Intro]
[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
This may be my last chance to speak
This may be your last chance to hear
Open your heart, open your mind
Please don't let this all be in vain

[Verse 2]
You've been waiting your whole life
To find something to live for
To find something to die for
This is your chance, don't pass it by

[Bridge]
Now is the time of God's amazing grace
Today is the day of your salvation

[Chorus]
Hear my words (listen to me)
Christ is your hope (listen to me)
He is what you seek (listen to me)
Trust in Him to save your soul (listen to me)

[Interlude]
[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
He stands at the door (knocking)
Don't send Him away (disbelieving)
Let Him into your life (today is the day)
For Christ is the Way

[Verse 4]
With blood on my hands, I seek forgiveness
With tears in my eyes, I plead for mercy
With love in my heart, I speak the truth
By faith in Christ, I will live again

And so can you

[Bridge]
Now is the time of God's amazing grace
Today is the day of our salvation

[Chorus]
Hear my words (listen to me)
Christ is your hope (listen to me)
He is what you seek (listen to me)
Trust in Him to save your soul (listen to me)

[Outro]
Listen, listen to me
Listen, oh listen to me
Listen, listen to me
Listen, oh listen to me

Listen to me

[Chorus]
Hear my words (listen to me)
Christ is your hope (listen to me)
He is what you seek (listen to me)
Trust in Him to save your soul (listen to me)

Listen to me

[Outro]
Listen, listen to me
Listen, oh listen to me
Listen, listen to me
Listen, oh listen to me

[Ending]
