  <p>This track happened because someone posted a picture of Old Rugged Cross from a hymnal on social media, and I thought "That song needs a metal cover."</p>

  <p>After a few attempts, I noticed the AI was finishing all the lyrics early, and then either repeating verses randomly, going off the rails with some weird piano solo, or both. Yeah, it's not very smart, and I'm not worried about Skynet destroying the world any time soon, haha.</p>

  <p>I finally managed to get it to generate something decent when I wrote a fifth verse for the song and added it in. It still repeated it randomly, even though I didn't specify that, but I think it still came out all right.</p>

[Intro]
[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
On a hill far away stood an old rugged cross,
The emblem of suffering and shame;
And I love that old cross where the dearest and best
For a world of lost sinners was slain.

[Verse 2]
O that old rugged cross, so despised by the world,
Has a wondrous attraction for me;
For the dear Lamb of God left His glory above
To bear it to dark Calvary. 

[Chorus]
So I'll cherish the old rugged cross,
'Till my trophies at last I lay down;
I will cling to the old rugged cross,
And exchange it someday for a crown.

[Interlude]
[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
In that old rugged cross, stained with blood so divine,
A wondrous beauty I see,
For 'twas on that old cross, Jesus suffered and died,
To pardon and sanctify me.

[Verse 4]
To that old rugged cross, I will ever be true,
Its shame and reproach gladly bear;
Then He'll call me some day to my home far away,
Where His glory forever I'll share.

[Chorus]
So I'll cherish the old rugged cross,
'Till my trophies at last I lay down;
I will cling to the old rugged cross,
And exchange it someday for a crown.

[Interlude]
[Instrumental]

[Verse 5]
For that old rugged cross, tho I may stand alone,
I will stand till the end of my days.
If the world sees a fool, then God's fool I remain,
'Till the foolish bewilder the wise.

[Chorus]
So I'll cherish the old rugged cross (old rugged cross),
'Till my trophies at last I lay down;
I will cling to the old rugged cross (old rugged cross),
And exchange it someday for a crown.

[Interlude]
[Instrumental]

[Verse 5]
For that old rugged cross, tho I may stand alone,
I will stand till the end of my days.
If the world sees a fool, then God's fool I remain,
'Till the foolish bewilder the wise.

[Outro]
So I'll cherish the old rugged cross (old rugged cross),
'Till my trophies at last I lay down;
I will cling to the old rugged cross (old rugged cross),
And exchange it someday for a crown.

[Ending]
[Instrumental]
