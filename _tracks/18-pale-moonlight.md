notes: |
  <p>This song is a very condensed version of a <a href="https://blog.efpophis.net/p/pale-moonlight.html" target=_blank>short story</a> I wrote. The story, in turn, is a very stylized and symbolized version of my own personal testimony. In all, I tell of how an encounter with the devil or a demon woke me up to the spiritual and sent me on a quest to escape his oppression.</p>

  <p>That quest led me to "try out" several different religions that didn't help at all, and eventually led me to what DID work: a personal relationship with God through Jesus Christ. Make no mistake - this is not a religion. There are no rituals to undergo, no sacraments you can receive, no actions you can take to have this. Belief, faith, love, and trust are what is required to be saved. Rituals and sacraments are to symbolize and remind us of who we believe in and what He did on our behalf. Works of love are the natural result of the Holy Spirit living within us: an outpouring to others of the love, mercy, and grace we have received.</p>

[Intro]
[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Making my way through the sands of time
I met a magic man, selling dreams by the sea
He said I could have whatever I could dream
All I had to do was win his game

[Verse 2]
"It's so simple and easy," he said with a smile
And I was desperate and broken, with nothing to lose
So I bet my soul, and I fell for the ruse
And I lost it all .. Oh yeah, I lost it all

[Hook]
[Instrumental]

[Bridge 1]
Now I search for redemption
And rest for my soul (my lost soul)

[Chorus 1]
I danced with the devil by the pale moonlight
And wagered my soul for a shot at the good life
I lost my way in the dark of the night
Now I'm trying to find my way
Back into the light

[Interlude]
[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
Years later, I met an old man down in New Orleans
He talked about Jesus, and how He died for me
Then he gave me a Bible and said I could be saved
"Truth is," he said, "you just have to believe."

[Verse 4]
The devil deceived me, but Christ rescued me
The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness must flee
Forgiveness and mercy are all that I need
In an old dusty bookshop, the truth set me free

[Bridge 2]
My search for redemption
Took such a long time (so much time)

[Chorus 2]
I danced with the devil by the pale moonlight
And wagered my soul for a chance at the good life
I lost my way in the dark of the night
But Jesus has brought me back into the light

[spoken] You better play that guitar!

[Interlude]
[Instrumental: guitar solo]

[Outro]
Now I'm back in the world to tell you my story
'Bout how Jesus can save you and bring you to glory
'Cause my Bible says that anyone, everyone can be saved
Truth is, my friend, you just have to believe

[spoken] that's right!

[Chorus 2]
'Cause danced with the devil by the pale moonlight
And wagered my soul for a chance at the good life
I lost my way in the dark of the night
But Jesus, He brought me back into the light

[spoken] Yes He did!

[Ending]
