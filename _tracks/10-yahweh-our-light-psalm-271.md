notes: |
  <p>I was trying to make an industrial / techno-metal song with this. The AI completely got the style wrong and gave me this screamo-black-metalcore abomination instead. The funny thing is, it's way better than what I was aiming for. I did have to do some remixing in order for it to pass the "car test," though, so this track has more editing than the rest of them.</p>

```text
[Verse 1]
In this present darkness, 
He's my everlasting light
Yahweh, My salvation
Yeshua, My guide
With Him by my side
I will never die (die)

[Chorus]
Yahweh o-ri ve-yish-i, mi-mi i-ra
Yahweh o-ri ve-yish-i, mi-mi i-ra
Yahweh ma-oz chai-yai, mi-mi ef-chad
Yahweh is my light, my salvation
Whom shall I fear?
Yahweh is the strength of my life,
Of whom shall I be afraid? (afraid?)

[Verse 2]
No fear can hold me
He won't let me fall
Yahweh, My fortress
Yeshua, My shield, my rock
In His embrace
I am saved by His grace
His kingdom, my soul awaits

[Chorus]
Yahweh o-ri ve-yish-i, mi-mi i-ra
Yah-weh ma-oz chai-yai, (Yah-weh ma-oz chai-yai) mi-mi ef-chad
Yahweh is my light, my salvation
Whom shall I fear?
Yahweh is the strength of my life,
Of whom shall I be afraid?
Of whom shall I be afraid?

[Repeat 3x]
Yahweh Our Light
In his presence
darkness shall die
even Death shall die
