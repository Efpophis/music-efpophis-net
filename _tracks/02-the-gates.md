notes: |
  <p>This is taken directly from a passage in The Divine Comedy by Dante Alighieri, a 12th-century Italian poet who defined what would become the Italian language with his poetry. The lyrics are the ominous words inscribed on the gates of Hell, culminating in the infamous "abandon all hope, you who enter here."</p>

  <p>Yes, it's about someone dying and finding themselves in Hell. Yes, it is supposed to make you uncomfortable. The grace of God, received by faith in Jesus Christ, is the only way to avoid this fate. Choose wisely.</p>

[Intro]
[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Through me, the way to the suffering city
Through me, the way to eternal pain
Through me, the way that runs among the lost (among the lost)
[Repeat Verse 1]


[Interlude]
[Instrumental]

[Verse 2]
Justice inspired my Great Builder.
My maker was Divine Authority:
The highest wisdom, the primal love.
Before me, only eternal things were made
And I endure eternally
(eternally)

[Interlude]
[Instrumental]

[Ending]
Abandon all hope (abandon all hope)
You who enter here (you who enter here)
Abandon all hope (abandon all hope)
You who enter here (you who enter here)
Abandon all hope (abandon all hope)
You who enter here (you who enter here)
Abandon all hope (abandon all hope)
You who enter here (you who enter here)
