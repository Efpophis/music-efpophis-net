  <p>Everyone knows about modern worship songs, right? The cheesy, repetitive, mush that gets shown on a screen for the congregation to sing along with in a lot of "modern" churches these days. Don't get me wrong, I actually like some of them. But, they're also ripe for a good parody.</p>

  <p>This track serves as an intro to the next one, so the two should be listened to one right after the other.</p>

[Verse]
This is the very model of a modern metal worship song:
It's cheesy and repetitive and altogether far too long.
And if you play it in your church, the audience will sing along!

[spoken]
And hey - it only takes up one slide on your PowerPoint, so the techs will like it just fine!

This is the very model of a modern metal worship song!
