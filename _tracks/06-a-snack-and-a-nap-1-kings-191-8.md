  <p>Well, that didn't take long. The Ba'al worshiping queen of Israel, who was not present at Mt. Carmel, has ordered her many loyalists to pursue and kill Elijah. He fled into the desert to hide. Depressed, angry, hungry, and thirsty, the prophet begs for death. But God has other plans.</p>

  <p>This song is very tongue-in-cheek and was inspired by a meme. Google the title, and I'm sure you'll find it.</p>

[Verse 1]
The prophet, afraid for his life
He flees to the desert and hides under a bush
Starving and thirsty, he's had enough
He cried, "Oh God, just let me die!"

[Verse 2]
An angel appeared while the prophet slept.
"Get up," he said, "have something to eat,
"I've got fresh-baked bread
And some delicious iced tea!"

[Chorus]
Sometimes when you think it can't get much worse
When you're out of your mind and dying of thirst
When the world wants you dead, 
And you think you'll oblige

[Spoken]
[A Capella]
Never underestimate the power .. of a snack and a nap.

[Ending]
