  <p>The astute listener will, no doubt, recognize the lyrics as being very similar to Centurion from my debut album, Death and Resurrection. That's because this is the same song, minus my re-writes.</p>

  <p>I found a recording from the old days on a cassette tape. It was really low quality and barely salvageable. You can find it as a bonus track on D&R. Anyway, as I've said before, this song was one that I wrote and composed back then, and it was always my favorite. I probably drove the other guys nuts wanting to play it all the time.</p>

  <p>I was able to recover the original lyrics from the tape recording, which is great since the 21st-century re-write came about entirely because I had forgotten a good chunk of them. So I decided to plug the old lyrics into the AI and see what would happen.</p>

  <p>The result nearly knocked me out of my chair.</p>

  <p>Somehow, the AI picked the same chord progression I had composed all those years ago and made it great. So, this version of the song is surprisingly faithful to the original, and I think it's how we all wished we could have played it back then.</p>

  <p>Of course, I can't just get a result like that and then not use it, so here it is.</p>

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
You came to me
Like so many had before
Doomed to die
I heard their shouts "Let him be crucified"

[Verse 2]
Bound by hand and foot,
I beat you with my scourge of rock and bone
I spilled your blood not knowing
It would one day save my soul
It would one day save my soul

[Chorus]
And now I come to you
I plead the blood
I shed by my own hand
Father God forgive me
For I knew not what I did

[Verse 3]
You left my whip
Beaten one lash short of death
You looked at me through hurt and bleeding eyes
And looking past the blood I saw the love
The love that crowns and crucifies
Crowns and crucifies

[Chorus]
And now I come to you
I plead the blood
I shed by my own hand
Father God forgive me
For I knew now what I did
I knew not what I did

[Verse 4]
You rose again
Like no one had before
Victorious over satan's darkest grave
And looking in your face I saw the light
And on my knees, I pray
And on my knees, I pray

[Chorus]
And now I come to you
I plead the blood
I shed by my own hand
Father God forgive me
For I knew now what I did
I knew not what I did

[Outro]
[Instrumental]
