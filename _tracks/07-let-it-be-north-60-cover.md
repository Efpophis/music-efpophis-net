  <p>The North 60 is a great little local project/band headed by Jim MacDonald, a friend of ours from the Redeemer days. This cover is very true to the original and is used here with explicit permission from Jim. I take no credit for any of this other than for seeing what the AI could do with it.</p>

[Verse 1]
Perfect rainy day, and everything washes away.
I can't see outside my window.
And I am turning gray, 
I'm useless as myself today.
Sometimes I wish that I didn't know.

[bridge]
How it feels to do the right thing 
When I'm faced with shame.
I'd like to turn my head and then let it go.
I'm just not who I was 
When I felt I could walk away.
Now I'm walking out of my own shadows.

[Chorus]
So let it be.
Let it come down.
I'm ready for it now.
Though I'm not sure what it means
To be a slave.
To be completely free.
Let it be.
Let it be.

[Verse 2]
Crazy afternoon
And I'm staring at my favorite gloom.
Now that I see it, I don't think so.
And I don't need those things
That one time made my spirit sing.
In the times when I didn't know.

[Bridge]
How it feels to be happy,
How it feels to be all right inside.
Took a lot of time for me to let go.
Of all the hate I know 
I stored up here inside my soul.
But now I'm walking out of my own shadows.

[Chorus]
And let it be.
Let it come down.
I'm ready for it now.
Though I'm not sure what it is 
To be a slave.
To be completely free.
Let it be.
Let it be.

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
Let it be.
Let it come down.
I'm ready for it now.
Though I'm not sure what it means
To be a slave.
To be completely free.
Let it be.
Let it be.

[Outro]
Let it be.
Let it come down.
I'm ready for it now.
Though I'm not sure what it means.
Make me a slave.
Make me completely free.
Let it be.
Let it be.

[Ending]
