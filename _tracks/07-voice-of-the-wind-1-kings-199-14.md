notes: |
  <p>Elijah now hides in a cave, battling what looks an awful lot like clinical depression if I'm being honest. But God is about to reveal Himself and teach an important lesson...</p>

  <p>The lesson is an important one for this age as well: God is not found in anger, hate, rage, judgment, disaster, etc. He's found in the comforting cool breeze, in gentleness, kindness, humility, and above all else, love.</p>

[Intro]
[Spoken] Peace! Be still, and know that I am God.

[Instrumental: guitar]

[Chorus]
The storm tore the mountains (But God was not in the storm)
The Earth trembled and quaked (But God was not in the earthquake)
Fire rained from the sky (but God was not in the fire)
At last, a gentle breeze (at last, the voice of God)

[Bridge]
Go outside, stand by the mountain, and see
The glory of Yahweh is here

[Verse]
Let the storms rage, let the earth shake
Let the fires burn, and the mountains break
God is not found in anger and rage
But in the gentle breeze, in the voice of the wind

[Spoken] He who has an ear, let him hear the voice of Yahweh.

[Chorus]
The storm tore the mountains (But God was not in the storm)
The Earth trembled and quaked (But God was not in the earthquake)
Fire rained from the sky (but God was not in the fire)
At last, a gentle breeze (at last, the voice of God)

[Bridge]
Go outside, stand by the mountain, and see
The glory of Yahweh is here

[Verse]
Let the nations rage, let their kingdoms fall
Let their hatred burn, and their spirits break
God is not found in violence and hate
But in perfected love, at the foot of the cross

[Spoken] Come to me, all who are weary, and I will give you rest.

[Chorus]
The storm tore the mountains (But God was not in the storm)
The Earth trembled and quaked (But God was not in the earthquake)
Fire rained from the sky (but God was not in the fire)
At last, a gentle breeze (at last, the voice of God)

[Ending]
[Spoken] My sheep know my voice, and follow their master.
