[Verse 1]
Under the altar of the Most High, we stand
Slain for the word of God (we bear witness)
We have paid in blood for our faith (our salvation by grace)
Before the LORD, we cry out:

[bridge]
[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
Oh God, you are holy! (holy and righteous)
Oh God, you are faithful! (just and true)
How long will you wait? (How long, oh lord?)
When will you avenge us? (I am coming soon)
When will you vindicate our blood?

[Instrumental]

[Verse 2]
White robes bestowed, we patiently await
Vengeance of the LORD (vengeance is mine)
For the roll must be complete (how long, oh lord?)
Our brothers and sisters must join us in martyrdom

[bridge]
[instrumental]

[Chorus]
Oh God, you are holy! (holy and righteous)
Oh God, you are faithful! (just and true)
How long will you wait? (How long, oh lord?)
When will you avenge us? (I am coming soon)
When will you vindicate our blood?

[Interlude]
[Instrumental]

[Outro]
Behold, the sixth seal is about to break
The sun shall be darkened, the whole earth shall shake
The moon shall flow as the blood of the dead
And the stars in the sky shall fall to the earth
The vengeance of God shall come upon mankind
And who can stand against Him?

[Chorus]
Oh God, you are holy! (holy and righteous)
Oh God, you are faithful! (just and true)
How long will you wait? (How long, oh lord?)
When will you avenge us? (I am coming soon)
When will you vindicate our blood?

[Ending]
