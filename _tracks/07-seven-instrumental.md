  <p>Way back in the day, I came up with a little riff I would play on any piano or keyboard I ran across. I would play it to warm up for band practice and gigs, in church when a bunch of us would hang around after service, etc. I always wanted to bring it to life, but never had the chance. Until now.</p>

  <p>To accomplish this, I actually re-composed the original riff in MuseScore note by note. That program then generated the intro, which I fed into the AI to expand upon. This track is the result, and it's very similar to how I always envisioned the whole piece. Very cool!</p>
