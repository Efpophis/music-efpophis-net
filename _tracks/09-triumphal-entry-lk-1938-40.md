notes: |
  <p>I actually recorded most of the making of this song and released it to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peraOQsuESQ" target=_blank>YouTube</a>. I obviously love singing in Hebrew, so I recorded myself singing one of the few Hebrew phrases I know well, fed it into the AI, and this (eventually) came out.</p>

[Intro]
[Interlude]
[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Hear, oh Israel, the time is near
The LORD your God is one
The LORD your God has come
In the fullness of time, He has sent His son, His son

[Verse 2]
He comes to you now, oh Jerusalem
Riding a donkey, he enters your gates
Wave your palms, and sing His praise
Hosanna to the Son of David!

[Bridge]
Blessed is he who comes 
In the name of the LORD
Jesus, our messiah

[Chorus]
ברוך הבא בשם אדונאי 
ברוך הבא בשם אדונאי 
ברוך הבא בשם אדונאי 
Yeshua ha Moshiach

[Interlude]
[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
Ever seeing, you cannot perceive
Ever hearing, you cannot understand
Honor me with words, but time will reveal
Tho your heart is against me, my mercy will heal

[Verse 4]
Come to me, come to me, my holy people
Gather to me, Oh precious Jerusalem
To those who are weary, I bring you rest
And in my name, you will never thirst again

[Bridge]
Blessed is he who comes
In the name of the LORD
Jesus, our messiah

[Chorus]
ברוך הבא בשם אדונאי 
ברוך הבא בשם אדונאי 
ברוך הבא בשם אדונאי 
Yeshua ha Moshiach

[Interlude]

[Outro]
ברוך הבא בשם אדונאי 
ברוך הבא בשם אדונאי 
ברוך הבא בשם אדונאי 
Yeshua ha Moshiach

Blessed is he who comes
In the name of the LORD
Jesus, our messiah

Language Notes and Translation:
  
The Hebrew text is pronounced "Baruch ha-ba b'ashem Adonai" and means "Blessed is he who comes in the name of the LORD." The next phrase sung in the chorus, "Yeshua ha Mosciach" is also Hebrew, but transliterated, and means "Jesus the Messiah" or "Jesus the Christ."  The word "Messiah" is translated to Greek as "Christ" and literally means "Anointed One."
