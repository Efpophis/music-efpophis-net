[Verse]
Hey Beckett!
Hey what?
Are you ready?
For what?
To pop!
Pop What?
POP SEE KO!

[Bridge]
My hands are high
My feet are low
And this is how I
POP SEE KO!

[Chorus]
Pop See ko!
Pop pop see ko!
Pop See ko!
Pop pop see ko!

[Verse]
Hey Asher!
Hey what?
Are you ready?
For what?
To pop!
Pop What?
POP SEE KO!

[Bridge]
My hands are high
My feet are low
And this is how I
POP SEE KO!

[Chorus]
Pop See ko!
Pop pop see ko!
Pop See ko!
Pop pop see ko!

[Verse]
Hey Everyone!
Hey what?
Are you ready?
For what?
To pop!
Pop What?
POP SEE KO!

[Bridge]
Our hands are high
Our feet are low
And this is how we
POP SEE KO!

[Chorus]
Pop See ko!
Pop pop see ko!
Pop See ko!
Pop pop see ko!
