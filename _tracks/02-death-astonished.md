notes: |
  <p>This is actually the first track I made for this album. It was inspired entirely by a single phrase from Requiem Ex Mortis: 'mors stupebit et natura', meaning 'death and nature shall be astonished'. I took that image and ran with it in the lyrics.</p>

  <p>There are three spoken sections (my own voice plus effects) that represent a booming "voice from on high" to explain things happening in the lyrics, or to ask questions, etc.</p>

[Intro]
[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
The time has finally arrived
The end is near, the end is here
The angel of the LORD descends in terrifying fury
At long last, the final trumpet sounds

[Interlude: short]

[Verse 2]
The sea gives up the dead within it
As life reborn springs forth from every tomb
The catacombs are opened, the dead, revived, come forth
some to life eternal, and some to die once more*

[spoken]
For the lake of fire is the second death,
And whoever was not found written in the book of life
Was cast into the lake of fire.

[Bridge]
Oh, death, where is your sting?
Oh, grave, where is your victory?

[Chorus]
The trumpet shall sound, the dead shall be raised (incorruptible, immortal)
And we shall all be changed
In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye (incorruptible)
And with strange eons come to pass, 
Even death shall die! 
SHALL DIE!

[Interlude]
[Instrumental: guitar solo]

[Verse 3]
Death, astonished, bows his head
His scythe crumbles into dust
and slips through his bony fingertips
abolished forever, never to return

[Interlude: short]

[Verse 4]
On skeletal knees, the reaper kneels
With a hollow hiss, he speaks his final words
The ultimate confession, as foreordained for all**:
Jesus Christ is LORD!!

[spoken] 
For every knee shall bow, and every tongue confess
That Jesus Christ is LORD, to the glory of God the Father.

[Bridge]
Oh, death, where is your sting?
Oh, grave, where is your victory?

[Chorus]
The trumpet shall sound, the dead shall be raised (incorruptible, immortal)
And we shall all be changed
In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye (incorruptible)
And with strange eons come to pass,
Even death shall die!
DEATH SHALL DIE!

[Interlude: short]

[Outro: spoken]
What shall we say, then? And how shall we escape
If we neglect so great a salvation
As that which is given to us
In Christ Jesus, our LORD?

[Bridge]
Oh, death, where is your sting?
Oh, grave, where is your victory?

[Chorus]
The trumpet shall sound, the dead shall be raised (incorruptible, immortal)
And we shall all be changed
In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye (incorruptible)
And with strange eons come to pass,
Even death shall die!
DEATH SHALL DIE!


[End]
