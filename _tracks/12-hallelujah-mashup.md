notes: |
  <p>There are a lot of songs called Hallelujah that everyone knows. The Hallelujah Chorus from Handel's Messiah, the haunting ballad by Leonard Cohen, etc.</p>

  <p>Few people know that Ludwig von Beethoven also wrote a Hallelujah chorus as part of his Oratorio, Christ on the Mount of Olives. I only know about it because ... guess .. yep, that's right - I sang it in high school choir! I remember it because it was AWESOME and fun to sing, and sounded majestic and dramatic .. just like you'd expect from Herr Beethoven.</p>

  <p>A metal cover of just this version was in the works, but it was not going well. Late in the process, it occurred to me to try a heavy metal mashup, using all the Hallelujahs as inspiration. Cohen's song just didn't fit in with the style of the other two, and for that reason, as well as to make sure to not run afoul of any copyright issues, I decided to focus on combining Handel and Beethoven's brilliant choruses, and, of course, give them the symphonic power metal treatment.</p>

  <p>I think it turned out quite well.</p>
