```text
[Chorus]
Elijah rock, shout, shout!
Elijah rock, comin' up lord.
Elijah rock, shout, shout!
Elijah rock, comin' up lord.

[Bridge]
Elijah...Elijah...Elijah...Elijah

[Verse 1]
Satan's a liar and a conjure too
If you don't watch out, he'll conjure you!
If I could I surely would
Just stand on the rock where Moses stood! (Where Moses stood!)

[Chorus]
Elijah rock, shout, shout!
Elijah rock, comin' up lord.
Elijah rock, shout, shout!
Elijah rock, comin' up lord.

[Bridge]
Elijah...Elijah...Elijah...Elijah

[Verse 2]
Elijah was a righteous man
His name means Yahweh is God in the holy land
He built an alter unto the Lord
Twelve rocks, twelve tribes for the God he adored

[Breakdown]
Elijah rock, Elijah rock, Elijah
Elijah rock, Elijah rock, Elijah
Elijah rock, Elijah rock, Elijah
Elijah rock, for the God he adored, God he adored

[Chorus]
Elijah rock, shout, shout!
Elijah rock, comin' up lord.
Elijah rock, shout, shout!
Elijah rock, comin' up lord.

[Outro]
Elijah...Elijah...Elijah...Elijah

SHOUT!
