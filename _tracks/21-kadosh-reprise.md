notes: |
  <p>Kadosh was the very first song I brought back to life with AI, decades after performing a different version one time live. The version from Death and Resurrection turned out so well that it got me started on this whole musical endeavor. It remains a straight-up banger, and a solid, no-compromise worship song. The only real problem it has is that I screwed up some of the Hebrew words and didn't know how to fix them.</p>

  <p>Back then, I had no idea what I was doing or what the AI was really capable of. Over the course of making all the songs and albums that followed, I learned a lot and got a lot better at this whole process. The AI has also gone through a few major upgrades and is now capable of generating much better audio quality and more complex structures, etc.</p>

  <p>So, here at the end of The Redeemer Project, I thought it would be appropriate to finally go back and fix up the beginning. I've managed to do so while retaining the original flavor of the song, but adding new dimensions, a better interval, a nicer structure, etc.. Oh, and I also fixed up the Hebrew, so it doesn't talk about anyone's teeth anymore.</p>
