[Bridge]
Sleep tight, little one
'cause soon, your Father's gonna come for you

[Verse 1]
In this world of hatred, where it's so hard to find love
There is a promise made by the Holy One
He's the one without blemish, He's the holiest of all
He's my hope and glory, and the One that never falls

[Chorus]
When there is nowhere else to turn, when your heart is aching 
For a love, when your cup is empty and you feel left alone
Know that there is peace wherever Jesus is found,
And in Him is your hope, Jesus is our hope

[mini-bridge]
Jesus is our hope
Jesus is our hope

[Verse 2]
Jesus came and died, it's His blood that made me free
It's time to grab the love that He's handing to you and me
And I have assurance you see, time is running out for you and me

[Bridge]
So sleep tight, little one
Cause soon your Father's gonna come for you

[Chorus]
When there is nowhere else to turn, when your heart is aching
For a love, when your cup is empty and you feel left alone
Know that there is peace wherever Jesus is found,
And in him is your hope, Jesus is our hope

[Bridge]
Peace in Jesus
Love comes from Jesus
Hope comes from Jesus
Life comes from Jesus

[Chorus]
When there is nowhere else to turn, when your heart is aching 
For a love, when your cup is empty and you feel left alone
Know that there is peace wherever Jesus is found,
And in Him is your hope, Jesus is our hope

[Chorus]
When there is nowhere else to turn, when your heart is aching 
For a love, when your cup is empty and you feel left alone
There is peace in Jesus
