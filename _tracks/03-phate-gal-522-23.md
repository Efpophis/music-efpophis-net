  <p>The title is pronounced "fate," but it's spelled the way it is to bring out the 'hate' sub-string and the techno-industrial feel of the music.</p>
  
  <p>I also wanted, intentionally, to convey a sense of anger in the tone and lyrics, which I think has happened rather successfully.</p>
  
  <p>This song is in response to the "Christians" out there who preach hatred, bigotry, racism, etc., and would deny others their God-given rights for those reasons, all while claiming that this is the will of God.</p>
  
  <p>Let me be clear: It is not.</p>
  
  <p>Sure, there are lots of people out there who live in sin, don't believe in God, and mock Him every day with their words and their actions. But at the end of the day, the only difference between any of us who call ourselves Christians and those "other sinners" is that we have received forgiveness from God. That doesn't make us any better, nor does it give us the right or authority to mistreat those who haven't yet: quite the opposite, in fact.</p>
  
  <p>Jesus calls on us to go out of our way, even to the point of laying down our lives, just as He did, for those people.</p>
  
  <p>I believe there is plenty of room in Heaven for all manner of sinners who accept God's free gifts of redemption, grace, and salvation. But there is no place there at all for people who pervert that message and harbor hatred in their hearts.</p>
  
  <p>And yet, even THOSE people are among the ones for whom Christ died. There is a path to salvation even for the lost soul waving the "God Hates ****" sign in your face, and that path is to accept the love and salvation freely offered by Jesus Christ, to turn away from hatred and become a channel of God's love for the world. This is what Christians are called to be - God Himself will handle the wrath when and if He decides to. Our job is to love our neighbor - and that means our gay neighbor, our atheist neighbor, our rich neighbor, our poor neighbor, our addicted neighbor, our Muslim neighbor, our racist douche-bag neighbor, etc..</p>

[Intro Instrumental]

[Verse]
You stand in my way, wave your sign in my face,
You say that God hates me, 'cause I'm not like you
Tell me, when did your faith become such a disgrace?

[Bridge]
God will not be mocked
Yahweh is no fool

[Chorus]
This is not a debate (so don't even try)
You have sealed your own fate (you're living a lie)
There is no place in heaven (on the day that you die)
For a soul so filled with hate

[Interlude Instrumental]

[Verse 2]
You've chosen your path, can you find your way back?
When your own heart condemns you as a vessel of wrath?
Tell me, when did your faith become such a disgrace?

[Bridge]
God will not be mocked
Yahweh is no fool

[Chorus]
This is not a debate (so don't even try)
You have sealed your own fate (you're living a lie)
There is no place in heaven (on the day that you die)
For a soul so filled with hate

[Interlude instrumental]

[Verse 3]
An eye for an eye leaves the whole world blind
Find a way to show love while you still have the time
Renounce all your hate and 
SURRENDER!!
TO JESUS CHRIST!!!!!

[Instrumental]
[Breakdown]

[Bridge]
God will not be mocked
Yahweh is no fool

[Outro]
This is not a debate (so don't even try)
You have sealed your own fate (you're living a lie)
There is no place in heaven (on the day that you die)

[Bridge]
God will not be mocked
Yahweh is no fool

[Outro]
This is not a debate (so don't even try)
You have sealed your own fate (you're living a lie)
There is no place in heaven (on the day that you die)
For a soul so filled with hate

[Ending]
