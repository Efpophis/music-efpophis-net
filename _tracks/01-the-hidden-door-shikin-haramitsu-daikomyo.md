notes: |
  <p>This introductory track is one of only 2 that have any vocals to them at all. The opening line, which says "shikin haramitsu daikomyo," features recordings of several of my fellow ninja and kunoichi (female ninja) speaking those words. The words translate roughly to "in every moment lies the potential for the enlightenment we seek."</p>

  <p>The remainder of the vocals are the ToShin Do student creed and codes of mindful action, spoken and recorded by me .. plus a little surprise at the end.</p>
