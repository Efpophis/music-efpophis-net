```text
[Verse 1]
Hopelessly outnumbered
Four hundred plus to one
The true prophet stood alone
On the mountain with his God

[Verse 2]
The priests of Ba'al gathered
In defiance, the challenge given
"If Yahweh is God, let Yahweh's altar burn"
"If Ba'al is God, let Ba'al's altar burn"

[Bridge]
Choose this day, oh Israel
Whom shall you serve?
Yahweh or Ba'al?

[Chorus]
Yahweh is my God (Eliyahu)
As for me and my house
We will serve Yahweh (Yahweh is God)
Forever (forever and ever)

[Verse 3]
For hours and hours, Ba'al's prophets called
"Ba'al, come help us! Hear us we pray!"
Cutting themselves, their devotion displayed (in rivers of blood)
But no answer, no fire ever came

[Verse 4]
"Where is your god, that demon, Ba'al?"
"Can he not hear you?" the lone prophet asked
"Maybe he's busy, or taking a nap?"
"Maybe he'll come if you make more noise!"

[Dialog]
Ba'al: you dare mock me?
Elijah (or is that Jack?): Ba'al, come on. You should know. Of COURSE, I dare mock you.

[Spoken] Now it's my turn.

[Verse 5]
Now drench the altar with water
Dig a trench around it and fill it, too
"Now, Yahweh, your prophet calls on You
"Show them Your power, kindle the fire!"

[Verse 6]
While he still spoke, the fire came down
Consumed the whole altar and dried up the ground
The prophets of Ba'al cried out in defeat
And made what you'd call a "hasty retreat"

[Bridge]
Choose this day, sons of Israel
Yahweh or Ba'al?

[Chorus]
Yahweh is my God (Eliyahu)
As for me and my house
We will serve Yahweh (Yahweh is God)
Forever (forever and ever)

[Bridge]
Choose this day, oh Israel
Whom shall you serve?
Yahweh or Ba'al?

[Outro]
Yahweh is my God (Eliyahu)
As for me and my house
We will serve Yahweh (Yahweh is God)
Forever (forever and ever)
Forever and ever

[Ending]
