[Intro]
[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Behold, the faithful dead
Clothed in white, in grace they stand
Cleansed by the blood of the lamb
Every nation, every tribe,
Every tongue, and every land
They stand before the throne
As one

[Verse 2]
Waving their palms, lifting their hands
They shout for joy
"Victory belongs to our God
Who sits upon the throne,
And to the lamb who was slain!"

[Bridge]
Let the angels kneel (with the faithful dead)
Let the elders bow (with the faithful dead)
Let every face touch the ground (before the throne)
Let them worship God alone (with the faithful dead)

[Chorus]
Praise and glory (halleluyah)
Wisdom and thanks (halleluyah)
Honor, power, and strength (halleluyah)
Be unto our God forever and ever (forever and ever)
Be unto the King of Glory (forever and ever)

[Interlude]
[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
Who are these people?  (Lord, you know)
They have suffered many things (Lord, you know)
They have cleansed their robes (Lord, you know)
In the blood of the lamb, they stand!

[Verse 4]
Before the throne, they serve Him (halleluyah)
Day and night, they serve Him alone (Lord, you know)
And He will shelter the faithful dead (Forever and ever)
They will never thirst again (behold the Faithful dead)

[Bridge]
Let the angels kneel (with the faithful dead)
Let the elders bow (with the faithful dead)
Let every face touch the ground (before the throne)
Let them worship God alone (with the faithful dead)

[Chorus]
Praise and glory (halleluyah)
Wisdom and thanks (halleluyah)
Honor, power, and strength (halleluyah)
Be unto our God forever and ever (forever and ever)
Be unto the King of Glory (forever and ever)

[Interlude]
[Instrumental]

[prechorus]
Life is faith
And faith is life 
He who believes in me
shall never die

[Outro]
In the final resurrection (halleluyah)
The faithful dead shall rise (Lord, you know)
At the end of all things (halleluyah)
The faithful dead shall rise (Lord, you know)
In the final resurrection (halleluyah)
The faithful dead shall rise (Lord, you know)
At the end of all things (halleluyah)
The faithful dead shall rise (Lord, you know)

[shout] RISE!!

[Ending]
