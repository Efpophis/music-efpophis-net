[Intro]
[Instrumental]

[verse 1] 
This is what happens 
When the moonlight hits the ocean
And I can't get the thought of you 
Out of my head 

[Verse 2]
This is what happens 
When no one else can see my tears 
And I can't shake the memories, 
So I'm out of my mind 

[chorus] 
We almost had everything 
We could have had it all 
With your hand in mine 
Oh, oh, oh
You were almost mine 
But I held the words too long
It's my tragedy, and my truth
No happy ending, just a song

[Interlude]
[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
This is what happens
When the night can't find the right words
And your name is the only sound I know

[Verse 4]
This is what happens
When my heart just won’t let it go
And the truth feels heavy on my tongue
But I don’t say anything at all ...

[Chorus]
We were almost something honest 
We were almost something true
You were almost worth the risk
But I kept it all from you
Oh, oh, oh
You were almost mine 
But I held the words too long
It's my tragedy, and my truth
No happy ending, just a song

[Ending]
Oo, oh, oo, oh
You were almost ... mine
