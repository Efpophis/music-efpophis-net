  <p>"You have not experienced Death Metal until you have heard it in the original Klingon."	-- paraphrasing Chancellor Gorkon</p>

  <p>I have been a Star Trek fan for as long as I can remember. The newer series, TNG and especially DS9, provided some great insights into Klingon culture that you just didn't get in the earlier shows and movies. I distinctly remember "Klingon Opera" making an appearance in a few episodes. It was as you'd expect - loud, obnoxious, cheesy.</p>

  <p>I remember thinking to myself, "Opera??? Come on .. Klingons would obviously be into death metal!"</p>

  <p>But, as much as I searched the internet, I could not find any good "Klingon Metal," let alone Klingon Death metal!</p>

  <p>So, I had my trusty AI friend make some. I don't speak Klingon, so I couldn't write lyrics for this. The ENTIRE thing, start to finish, is AI-generated. I have not edited it in the slightest. I'm including it in this album because it's fun, and there really should be more Klingon Death Metal in the world.</p>

[Verse 1]
Sokath, his eyes uncovered
Ha'DIbaH DaSovredegh
jum ghewwmey ghoSogh
Ha'lIgh, jISovqo' quv chavmoH

[Chorus]
Stovokor, jI'Hegh
ba'la jIlop DaneH'a'
Stovokor, jI'Hegh
ba'la jIlop puj'a'

[Verse 2]
Kahless descends, his fury unrelenting
Qo'noS chIS, jISovqo' mab vIlo'chugh
ruv juppu'laHbe' je jollob' 'ej nuv
bachDu', huj neH Ha' ram nuv

[Chorus]
Stovokor, jI'Hegh
ba'la jIlop DaneH'a'
Stovokor, jI'Hegh
ba'la jIlop puj'a'

[Chorus]
Stovokor, jI'Hegh
ba'la jIlop DaneH'a'
Stovokor, jI'Hegh
ba'la jIlop puj'a'
