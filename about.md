# Author Bio

I am a Gen-X computer geek and wanna-be musician. I dabble with keyboards, guitars, bass, and vocals, but my talent with them is minimal. This is largely due to the fantastically small amount of time I have to practice any of them.  But, I have lots of ideas, and I'm at least pretty good at writing lyrics, establishing rhythm, and certain audio engineering tasks.

With that in mind, one can easily extrapolate what happens when you put me in front of a generative AI and tell me to have a blast. You get stuff like what's on the rest of this page.

Make no mistake, this stuff is not simply the result of typing in a prompt and letting AI do everything. I create the lyrics myself - tho sometimes I do use AI assistance. Even then, I always refine them and edit them heavily so they say what I want to say, not what Skynet wants to say.  I arrange the song structures. There are several songs that I have derived from recordings of myself playing an instrument, or singing, or both.

The AI comes up with the music, yes. But, for every good and usable version of a song, the AI also produces anywhere from a dozen to hundreds of duds. I sort through all of those and pick the one that I think is the best.  Then, I use a Digital Audio Workstation to refine the result, add effects, samples, etc., to make it better.

You can see an example of the process [here](https://youtu.be/peraOQsuESQ?si=_YofF5wbj26nXZ6v).

# Projects

A brief overview of the projects on this page.

## The Redeemer Project

The one that started it all. The intent here was to revive some of the songs from the Olden Days when I used to play in a real-live garage band called "Redeemer." You can see more about it on my <a href="https://blog.efpophis.net/p/the-redeemer-project.html" target=_blank>personal blog</a>.  The Redeemer Project's final album was [Seven](/albums/seven).

## Instrumental Works (Bill Crossley)

I've made a couple of experimental instrumantal / meditative compilations that are not Christian in nature. These can be found [here](/project/instrumental-projects), and are released with my own name as the "Artist."

## Death Astonished

This is my new "band name" moving forward for Christian metal and other genre projects. The name comes form a line in the Requiem mass that says "mors stupebit et natura," meaning "death and nature will be astonished."  The album [Mors Stupebit](/albums/mors-stupebit), originally released with the "artist" set to "Bill Crossley," has been re-mastered and re-relesed under this name since it's a more appropriate place for it, and the album needed a kick in the bass.

# Faith's Influence

I don't feel the need to say a whole lot here about my personal faith and beliefs. The music I release and the lyrics should make that obvious. More importantly, I hope the way I live my life makes it obvious as well. My faith naturally expresses itself through the music I listen to and write, and that's just how it is. I have written some secular stuff, but I feel it's not as good and not yet worth releasing. Even that stuff is just fun, and doesn't really fit the typical metal, death-metal, or black-metal molds.

With that said, I make no apologies for the message of my music, nor its style, nor my method of creating. God has directed and helped with every lyric, every song. As long as He is pleased, and I believe He is, no one else's opinion or judgement matters.
