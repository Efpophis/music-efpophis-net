## Author Bio

I am a Gen-X computer geek and wanna-be musician. I dabble with keyboards, guitars, bass, and vocals, but my talent with them is minimal. This is largely due to the fantastically small amount of time I have to practice any of them.  But, I have lots of ideas, and I'm at least pretty good at writing lyrics, establishing rhythm, and certain audio engineering tasks.

With that in mind, one can easily extrapolate what happens when you put me in front of a generative AI and tell me to have a blast. You get stuff like what's on the rest of this page.

Make no mistake, this stuff is not simply the result of typing in a prompt and letting AI do everything. I create the lyrics myself - tho sometimes I do use AI assistance. Even then, I always refine them and edit them heavily so they say what I want to say, not what Skynet wants to say.  I arrange the song structures. There are several songs that I have derived from recordings of myself playing an instrument, or singing, or both.

The AI comes up with the music, yes. But, for every good and usable version of a song, the AI also produces anywhere from a dozen to hundreds of duds. I sort through all of those and pick the one that I think is the best.  Then, I use a Digital Audio Workstation to refine the result, add effects, samples, etc., to make it better.

You can see an example of the process [here](https://youtu.be/peraOQsuESQ?si=_YofF5wbj26nXZ6v).
