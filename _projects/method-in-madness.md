This is a dumping-ground project for stuff that doesn't really fit anywhere else. Inside, you'll find many different genres, moods, etc. There's a few parodies, some experiments gone wrong, some experiments gone right, humor (some of it crude - there's a song about pooping), etc.

These are one-offs, remixes, parodies, etc., and should not be taken with even the least little bit of seriousness.

You've been warned.
