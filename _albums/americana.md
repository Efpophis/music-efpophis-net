This "single" was a random idea that came to me when someone posted a rendition of Star Spangled Banner to a chat room I was in around mid-June, 2024. I thought it would be fun to put together a short release of a few American patriotic songs from the public domain and release it on July 4.

As it turns out, there aren't a whole lot of good patriotic songs in the public domain. So I did three. 

The fourth track is something special - be sure to check out the commentary for that one, specifically.

The Redeemer Project thanks:

* My Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, the first and the last, and everything in between.
* My sensei, Ryan Antoshi Marchand, for his ongoing work of instructing me in the way of the Ninja, and for letting me steal his song "Warrior Protector."
* Stryper for their rendition of Battle Hymn of the Republic, which partially inspired this album.
* Metallica for their song "Don't Tread On Me," which also helped inspire this idea. Don't worry, Lars, I didn't steal any of your stuff.
* as always, every Christian metal artist ever. I'm just messing around with a computer - you guys are the real deal.
