This is another thing I have always wanted to do. I realize very few will 'get it' and probably even fewer will actually like it. Oh well.

This is a Requiem mass in black metal (mostly), with a few additions, variations, weird arrangements, etc. As such, it is definitely dark, heavy, and intense. 

This is a much darker, heavier album than any of my other ones, so I needed some out-of-the-box cover art to go with it. Hence the departure from the traditional black-and-white logo.

The title, "Requiem Ex Mortis," means "rest that comes from death," roughly translated.

The "IC XC NIKA" symbol comes mainly from Greek orthodoxy and stands for "Iesu Christe Nika" which means "Jesus Christ Conquers" in Greek. It also happens to be my favorite Christogram.
