This is my first non-Redeemer Project album. While I couldn't resist doing a couple more Redeemer-era covers, you'll find that the rest of the album is quite different, yet still familiar. It's still me, after all.

I have re-mastered this whole album to give the bass a little boost and clean up the mix a little bit, now that I've learned some proper audio engineering techniques.  I'm also re-releasing it under my new "band" name:  Death Astonished.

I followed a bit of a different approach this time. Rather than come up with an over-arching concept and fill in the tracks for it, this time I just let tracks come naturally as I got ideas for new songs. As such, I've been working on this thing slowly since about April of 2025.

Mostly, I just tried to make some music that I would enjoy hearing.
