This is a dumping-ground album for tracks that don't really fit anywhere else. These are mostly secular, some parodies, some remixes that I never released elsewhere, etc. It's a hodge-podge of genres, too. You'll find everything from black metal to blues to country in here. It is what it is. You've been warned.

This "album" will always be a work in progress. I will periodically add new stuff to it as it is created. As such, your best bet is to stream it or download it from Audiomack.
