I wanted to do a Christmas album (and it's currently the middle of July as I'm typing this), and I was heavily inspired by the Christmas concerts I used to sing in during my years in high school choir. Most of these songs, therefore, I have actually performed live - tho in a much different genre. Our concerts would ALWAYS begin with Oh Come All Ye Faithful, and end with Oh Holy Night. Therefore, so does this album - if you don't count the bonus track, since every Redeemer Project album must have a Klingon Death Metal song.

All the lyrics are in the public domain, with the following exceptions:

 * the entirety of qeylIS mInDu' (obviously) - those are mine, having been generated by the AI and edited by me.
 * the second verse in "What Child is This" is of my own composition. I didn't like the traditional second verse, so I re-wrote it. But I'll go ahead and release it to the public domain as well. If you're reading this and you want to use it in something of your own, go right ahead.

 All lyrics in this album are in the public domain, by virtue of either:
   * they are ancient enough to fall there by law
   * I have written them myself and released them there
