I've long been a fan of Elijah (pronounced Eliyahu in Hebrew) the Tishbite - the Old Testament prophet whose name means "Yahweh is my God." 

Among other things, Elijah hilariously mocked the false god Ba'al before showing his followers who's really in charge (see the title track for details). So, I decided to do a concept album based on him - Elijah, not Ba'al.

As you have probably come to expect from me, I am still making liberal use of the Divine Name, Yahweh, in the lyrics. I've also got some Hebrew thrown in here and there, which should sound better now that I figured out how to write it using Hebrew characters instead of trying to get the AI to understand transliterations.

Sound and style-wise, I think this is the most cohesive album I've made so far. It is definitely a metal album, and there are very few (2, I think, only one of which was on purpose) songs that diverge from the overall metal with a mid-east vibe. While my other works have had a lot of experimentation and weird genre combos, the goal here was to be consistent, at least for the main body of the album. So there are no Blues, Rap, or other oddities here.

The "Elijah Concept" ends with track 10, Elisha. After that, I get into some generic Christian metal and even a little satire. Of course, no Redeemer Project album is complete without a Klingon Death Metal track, so there's one of those, too.

I enjoyed making this album a lot. It feels like the most creative and thoughtfully crafted work I've done so far. I hope you like listening to it as much as I do.
