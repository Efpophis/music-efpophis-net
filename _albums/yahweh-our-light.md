## If you do nothing else while you're here, please read [this](https://blog.efpophis.net/p/the-redeemer-project.html). 

This is my second AI-generated album, and, depending on how much more inspiration I have, it may be the last one for a while.

My purpose for this remains the same: to glorify God the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit with music that I enjoy, and to see what kind of crazy the AI would generate this time around.

For this effort, I wanted to experiment some more with different genres and combinations, and more complex song structures. There was a software upgrade to the AI about midway through my effort, and another upgrade in my understanding of the commands it could interpret in the lyrics, so some of these songs turned out very good with interesting structures, if I do say so myself. I also wanted the heavier songs to be heavier, louder, more intense, and more extreme. Some of them, like the title track, may even be difficult to listen to - this is intentional and meant to reflect the all-out, no-holds-barred, go-loud-or-go-home devotion to God that we should all have in our hearts. I realize the styles are not for everyone - there's even a gangsta-rap song, and I absolutely LOATHE rap music, for example.

I also wanted to be a little less preachy and a little more ... praise-y? .. with this effort. The gospel and message of salvation in Jesus Christ is timeless and extremely important, though, and I believe I thoroughly covered it in the commentary on my first album, Death and Resurrection. If you found this one, you should be able to find it very easily. Thus, I don't feel the need to repeat it again here - it should be very visible in the content of both albums.

You will notice that I continue to liberally use the Divine Name, Yahweh, instead of the more traditional LORD or even Adonai in some Hebrew lyrics. I do this because that is the name He gave us to use, and I see no point in obscuring it, especially when worshipping Him in song.

Further, I have occasionally used the Hebrew name Yeshua to refer to Jesus. I do this simply because that is the actual name that his disciples called him to his face - and because it fits the lyrics.

The cover art is AI-generated this time .. well, mostly. I added the band logo and the strange writing. The writing, by the way, is in the Phonecian/paleo-Hebrew alphabet - the first alphabet, in fact. It's pronounced "Yahweh 'or" and means "Yahweh Light" or perhaps "Yahweh Our Light" - the title of the album.
