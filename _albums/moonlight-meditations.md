This is an experiment turned concept album. I wanted to see if I could generate a series of tracks in the same key and have them blend together as a symphony-like composition. It seems to work well enough.

These are all instrumental, and all in the key of D, Dorian mode - or at least they should be, since that's what I told the AI to do. It's meant to be background music, which can be used for prayer and meditation, or whatever. I've titled the tracks the way I have to encourage meditation on the 9 "Fruits of the Spirit," found in the book of Galatians in the New Testament, while tying in First Corinthians 13, aka "the love chapter," for the finale.

This was a very interesting album to make technically, since I had to blend all the tracks into one, and then split, fade, etc. to make it sound right.
