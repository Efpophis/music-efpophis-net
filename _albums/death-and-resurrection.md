Ultimately, I am making this album to express my faith in Jesus Christ, to worship him with music that I like, and to share my own testimony in the hope that maybe someone, somewhere, will hear it and be inspired to Believe in Him for the first time, or once again. That said, there are a few songs on here that are not of an overtly Christian nature, but it is still there, under the surface - except for the Klingon one, which is just for fun. 

The message I want to convey is this: Jesus Christ is the only Son of God, who was born of the Virgin Mary. He healed the sick and preached the gospel with his disciples. Then he was crucified, dead, and buried. On the third day, He rose from the dead, defeating sin and death once and for all time. Every human being is, by nature, a sinner and therefore incapable of a relationship with God, and if they die in this state, will not enter heaven. But, through Jesus, God has provided a way for us to be saved, forgiven, reconciled with him, and to have eternal life in heaven. All we have to do is believe in Jesus and trust him to forgive our sins. This is not something we can earn. There is no ritual or sacrament that we must receive. It is a gift we freely receive. We need only admit our sinfulness, repent of it, ask God in faith for forgiveness and eternal life, and commit to following Jesus. If you are reading this and have not done so, then I hope these words and this music will encourage and inspire you to make that decision today.

If that can happen even once, then I will have accomplished everything I have set out to do.

I've called this album 'Death and Resurrection' primarily because the contents focus on the death and Resurrection of Jesus Christ - the historical fact on which our faith relies. In a sense, I am also 'resurrecting' these old songs, giving them new life through new technology (and a little new talent) that was not available back in the day. I have taken some liberties in editing the original lyrics - some of them extensive.

One thing you'll notice that I want to touch on here is that I make liberal use of the Divine Name, Yahweh, throughout many of the songs. I have done this in order to be more true to the original inspiration for these words, that is, God Himself, who gave Israel and the world that Name to address and invoke him. Over the years, the Name has been treated as being so sacred that, traditionally, no one dared speak it lest it be blasphemed accidentally, instead substituting Adonai (heb) or The LORD (English). In fact, whenever you see "The LORD" in, for example, the King James Bible, the original text actually says Yahweh. Hence, in Kadosh, the singer proclaims "Holy Holy Holy Holy, Yahweh God Lord of hosts" using the actual name as written in the scripture that inspired it. I do not believe that "accidental blasphemy" is possible, as blasphemy originates in the heart with the intent to blaspheme. I do, however, believe we are missing out on manifold blessings by not invoking our God with the Name He gave us to use for that purpose. So .. yeah, I went a little nuts with it, but I trust that's ok.
